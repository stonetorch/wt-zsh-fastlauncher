# test_runner_leftover_audit.ps1
#
# PROOF SUITE for the runner's per suite desktop audit. It does not test psmux;
# it tests the runner, by deliberately being the kind of badly behaved suite the
# audit exists to catch.
#
# BACKGROUND
# After three full sweeps the desktop held about 33 Windows Terminal windows with
# six dead tabs each, hosting 121 processes whose command line was exactly
# `C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c pause`, all parked at "Press any key". None of
# them were descendants of any suite: the runner puts every suite in a Job Object
# with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE, and the job kill had already run. Without attribution
# the only evidence was the pile of tabs, so run_all_tests.ps1 now snapshots the
# desktop around every suite, names whatever is new, ends it and closes its
# window. This suite is what proves that machinery actually fires.
#
# IT LEAKS TWO CONSOLES ON PURPOSE, BY TWO DIFFERENT ROUTES
#
#   A. IN JOB. A plain `Start-Process cmd.exe /c pause`. It is a descendant of
#      this script, therefore a member of the suite's job object, therefore the
#      job kill should reap it. This is the control: it proves the existing job
#      teardown still works and that the audit does not invent leftovers.
#
#   B. OUTSIDE THE JOB. Created through Win32_Process.Create, so the new process
#      is a child of WmiPrvSE.exe and has never been a member of this suite's job
#      object. TerminateJobObject cannot touch it, and it gets a real visible
#      console window in the interactive session. This is the same SHAPE as the
#      real world leak (a console whose creator is not in the job, left parked on
#      a keypress that never comes), and the only thing that can clean it up is
#      the runner's audit.
#
#   Win32_Process.Create also reproduces the exact command line shape seen in the
#   wild, `cmd.exe /c pause` with no quoting, rather than the quoted form
#   PowerShell produces. Both shapes must be recognised, so the suite leaks one
#   of each.
#
# WHY IT SKIPS WHEN RUN BY HAND
# A suite that leaks a console window would, run standalone, leave that window on
# the desktop: exactly the thing being fixed. So it only leaks when the runner is
# the caller, which it detects through PSMUX_TEST_RUNNER=1 (set by
# run_all_tests.ps1 for every suite it starts). Run by hand it SKIPS and touches
# nothing.
