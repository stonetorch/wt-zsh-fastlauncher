# Issue #408 / discussion #430: attach-session -t <name> must honour the target
# instead of reattaching to the `last_session` marker.
#
# Root cause: the global arg scan strips -t out of cmd_args, so the attach branch
# re-parsed -t from the stripped args (found none) and fell through to
# resolve_last_session_name_ns. Whenever last_session pointed at a DIFFERENT
# session, `attach-session -t s2` silently landed on last_session (e.g. s1).
#
# Deterministic proof without an interactive TTY: launch the attach client with
# Start-Process, then ask the server (via list-clients) which session the client
# actually joined. list-clients prints "<pts>: <session>: ...".

# --- Test 4: bare `attach` (no -t) picks the most recently active session ---
#
# This case used to assert the opposite, that a bare attach follows the
# `last_session` file, and called that tmux parity. It is not. Measured against
# tmux 3.4 with two detached sessions created in order s1 then s2 and no client
# anywhere:
#
#   s1 created=1787878619 activity=1787878619
#   s2 created=1787878620 activity=1787878620
#   tmux display-message -p '#S'  ->  s2
#
# tmux resolves an unqualified target through cmd_find_best_session, which ranks
# by activity_time and consults no "last session" file at all. psmux's global
# last_session file was written once per attach and never refreshed, so a
# session visited long ago and since detached kept winning: that is #603, and
# the fallback this case pinned was the bug rather than the contract.
#
# What #408 is actually about is that an EXPLICIT target must never lose to that
# fallback, which Tests 1, 2, 3 and 5 cover. Here the expectation is now tmux's:
# with no target given, the most recently active session wins, so pointing
# last_session at the OLDER s1 must not drag the attach away from s2.
# The activity ranking itself is proven in tests/test_issue603_bare_routing.ps1.
