# An idle attached client must not talk to its server in a loop.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
# --------------------
# The event driven input path replaced several poll intervals with wakes. One of
# those wakes fired on every line the client read off its socket, including the
# server's "NC" reply, which means "nothing has changed". That is self
# sustaining: the NC wakes the client's input wait, the loop goes round and sends
# another dump-state, the server answers NC, and that NC wakes the loop again. A
# request/reply spin at TCP round-trip rate between two processes that both have
# nothing to do, costing up to 92% of a core across the pair.
#
# It shipped. Three separate CPU sampling runs failed to catch it, because this
# machine runs other work and the innocent build sampled as high as 13% of a
# core while the broken one sometimes sampled at 1%. The bug is bistable: it only
# latches when the client's refresh gate lets a request through immediately after
# an NC, so a handful of clean samples proves nothing.
#
# Counting events instead of sampling CPU makes it deterministic and immune to
# whatever else the machine is doing. Measured over a 10s idle window with a
# silent pane, client socket reads per second:
#
#   before the wake was added       0.1 to 192
#   with the wake firing on NC      3332 to 8660
#   with the NC gate               0.1 to 189
#
# The two populations are separated by more than an order of magnitude, so the
# threshold below is nowhere near either one.
#
# WHAT "IDLE" MEANS HERE
# ----------------------
# The pane runs tests/echo_load_child.cs with no filler output, so the pane
# produces nothing, and nothing is typed. Every line crossing the socket in the
# measurement window is therefore the client and server talking among
# themselves.
#
# IDLE IS SILENT, NOT CHEAP: THE SECOND CEILING
# ---------------------------------------------
# The 600/sec ceiling above catches the wake spin and nothing smaller, and the
# "0.1 to 192" spread quoted for the healthy build is the tell: 192 lines/sec is
# not a refresh cadence, it is the SAME request/reply loop latching through a
# different door. An idle client has no refresh cadence at all. It sends
# dump-state when it has a reason to (a key went out, the terminal resized, the
# server told it to) and otherwise waits, because the server pushes a frame
# whenever pane state changes.
#
# The door was `force_dump`, the client's "send one dump-state now" flag. It was
# cleared at the BOTTOM of the client loop, and every early `continue` in that
# loop -- no frame this iteration, a frame identical to the last one, a frame
# that failed to parse -- skips the bottom. So one latched flag re-sent
# dump-state on every iteration, for ever, and the server answered "NC" in two
# bytes, which is why nothing looked like traffic and why three CPU sampling
# runs disagreed with each other. Measured on e49fd97 over an 8 s window with a
# settled pwsh prompt and nothing typed: 2402 client socket reads, 2402 of them
# the 3 byte "NC", 187 per second. It also drags the server's process table
# walker in behind it, because every dump-state runs the automatic-rename check:
# 7 CreateToolhelp32Snapshot walks in that same idle window, at 9 to 11 ms each,
# none of which an idle server has any reason to do.
#
# So this suite asserts TWICE on one measurement: the loose ceiling keeps
# catching the wake spin, and `QuietLinesPerSec` asserts what idle actually is.
# With the flag cleared on the request that satisfies it, the same window
# measures 0 to 2 lines in ten seconds. The two populations are 0.2/sec against
# 187/sec, so the 5/sec gate sits two orders of magnitude below the bug and
# still leaves room for a frame the server legitimately pushes while "idle"
# (a status clock tick, an alert flag clearing).
#
# TWO CELLS, BECAUSE THE LATCH IS BISTABLE
# ----------------------------------------
# Cell 1 attaches and types nothing. Whether the latch catches there is a race
# on the first dump-state reply, so the same unfixed build measured 0.1, 6.9 and
# 183 lines/sec across three runs of cell 1. A gate that only fails half the time
# is how this shipped twice already.
#
# Cell 2 arms it on purpose, and needs nothing but one keystroke and a pane that
# does not answer:
#   * the pane is `pwsh -Command "Start-Sleep -Seconds 600"`, which reads its
#     input and writes NOTHING, so the key produces no pane output,
#   * one key goes into the client's console (tests/keylat.cs, `--n 1`), which
#     sets `force_dump`,
#   * the server therefore has nothing new and answers "NC", so the client's
#     loop takes the `!got_frame` continue and never reaches the bottom where
#     the flag was being cleared.
# From there an unfixed client re-sends for ever, with nothing on either side to
# break the cycle. Measured: 148 to 190 lines/sec on the unfixed client in this
# cell, every run, against 0.1 with the flag cleared on the request. Cell 2 is
# asserted on the quiet gate only - the loose ceiling is cell 1's history.
#
# WHAT IS RECORDED
# ----------------
# The whole point of this suite is a cost an idle pair is paying, so the same
# idle window that counts socket lines also samples the server's and the
# client's working set, private bytes, thread count and CPU, the CPU reported as
# a percentage of one core over that window. No extra sleep is added for it: the
# snapshots are taken at the two ends of the window this suite was already
# sitting through, which is the window the assertion is about. Sampling the CPU
# is not the assertion - the header above is the record of why counting events
# is - but a build that keeps the line count down by spinning somewhere else is
# then visible instead of invisible.
#
# The result lands in %USERPROFILE%\.psmux-test-data\metrics\ with the schema 2
# envelope shared by every perf gate (tests\perf_metrics_common.ps1), so the
# build that produced a number is recorded with it and tests\perf_summary.ps1
# can line this suite up against the others. Never inside the repo.
