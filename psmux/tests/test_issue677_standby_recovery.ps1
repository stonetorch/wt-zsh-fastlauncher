# Issue #677: the standby must come back on its own, and a spawn lock left by a
# holder that is gone must not keep it missing.
#
# The standby is a separate server process named __warm__ whose whole purpose is
# that `new-session` does not have to pay for a cold spawn. It used to be
# spawned from exactly two places, a server starting up and a claim being
# answered, with nothing retrying, and the lock that serialises the spawn was
# judged stale by the file's AGE alone rather than by whether the process named
# in it still existed.
#
# Measured before the fix, in an isolated data root:
#   - standby killed with a live session beside it: no standby returned in 90 s
#   - a lock naming a dead pid: no standby after a creation (12 s), none after a
#     further 25 s, and one appeared instantly on the NEXT creation once the age
#     rule finally allowed the steal
#
# Everything here runs in a private -L namespace and a private data root, and
# nothing is ever killed by image name.
