.SYNOPSIS
    EXTREME robustness campaign: Concurrent TCP client torture + AUTH enforcement.

.DESCRIPTION
    Namespace: -L rbTcp (socket-namespaced). NEVER touches the global server.
    Files live at $env:USERPROFILE\.psmux\rbTcp__<session>.port / .key (DOUBLE underscore).

    Thesis: the psmux TCP server (line protocol on 127.0.0.1:<port>) ENFORCES auth,
    TOLERATES many concurrent/abusive clients, and NEVER wedges.

    Handshake: send "AUTH <key>\n"; server replies a line "OK" (or rejects/closes).
    After OK: commands like "list-sessions\n", "new-window\n", "dump-state\n".
    A client may opt into a persistent stream with "PERSISTENT\n".

    This script PROVES expected outcomes (auth granted/denied, state present/absent,
    server still alive after abuse) rather than merely "did not crash".

    SAFETY: cleanup is ONLY `psmux -L rbTcp kill-server` in finally. No global kills,
    no Get-Process psmux | Stop-Process.

    DOES NOT depend on a particular reply format: "alive" is proven by a fresh
    authenticated connection successfully retrieving a listing that contains the
    session name rbTcp_main.
