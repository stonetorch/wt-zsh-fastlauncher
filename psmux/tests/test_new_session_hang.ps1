# Zero-hang regression: `new-session -d` must NEVER block indefinitely on a
# doomed server, and must fail FAST when the server is provably dead.
#
# Two scenarios, both via debug-only fault injection (compiled out of release):
#
#  H1 DEAD SERVER, NO CLEANUP (PSMUX_TEST_DIE_AFTER_PORTFILE):
#     The server writes its .port file then hard-exits WITHOUT running its panic
#     hook, leaving a stale .port. The pre-fix client would loop until its 15s
#     deadline (.port never vanishes, connect never succeeds). The fixed client
#     polls the spawned server PID and fails fast the instant it dies.
#     ASSERT: rc != 0 AND elapsed well under the 15s deadline (< 5s).
#
#  H2 ALIVE BUT HUNG create_window (PSMUX_TEST_WINDOW_DELAY_MS = 60000):
#     The server is alive, .port written, accept loop up, but create_window is
#     stuck "forever" (60s >> 15s). list-windows stays empty and the PID stays
#     alive, so no fast-fail signal applies. The client must still return at its
#     bounded 15s deadline, never block for 60s or indefinitely.
#     ASSERT: rc != 0 AND elapsed in [12s, 20s] (bounded, not 60s, not infinite).
#
# Removal recipe: if the PSMUX_TEST_DIE_AFTER_PORTFILE / PSMUX_TEST_WINDOW_DELAY_MS
# hooks are deleted from server/mod.rs, delete this test.
