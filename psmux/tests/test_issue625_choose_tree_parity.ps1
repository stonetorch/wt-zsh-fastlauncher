# Issue #625: prefix+w (choose-tree) must behave like tmux's mode-tree.
#
# Reported by fekir with `renumber-windows on`, `base-index 1` and
# `pane-base-index 1`. Four gaps, all reproduced on the unfixed build with a
# real attached client, WriteConsoleInput keystrokes and a console screen read:
#
#   1. tmux jumps on the BARE digit. psmux opened a "go to N" prompt and waited
#      for Enter.
#   2. tmux starts with the windows COLLAPSED (`choose-tree -w` sets
#      WINDOW_TREE_WINDOW, and window_tree_build_window then passes
#      expanded = 0), so the visible lines are the sessions and their windows.
#      psmux listed every pane too, so the list was 10 rows deep for 4 windows.
#   3. `0` was dead and it soft locked the dialog: the jump buffer only accepted
#      1..len, "0" fell to the None arm which deliberately KEPT the buffer, and
#      every later Enter re-took that same dead branch.
#   4. Because panes were listed, the digit needed depended on how many panes
#      each window had, so the window number in the status bar was useless.
#
# tmux ground truth (C:\Users\godwin\Documents\workspace\tmux):
#   mode-tree.c mode_tree_build_lines  -> `mti->key = '0' + mti->line`, a ZERO
#                                         based index over the VISIBLE lines
#   mode-tree.c mode_tree_key          -> `mtd->current = choice; *key = '\r';`
#                                         so the digit jumps AND activates
#   window-tree.c window_tree_build_window -> `expanded = 0` under -w
#
# Layout used here: one session, four windows (base-index 1) where window 2
# holds THREE panes. Under tmux rules the visible lines are
#   0 session, 1 window 1, 2 window 2, 3 window 3, 4 window 4
# so digit N picks window N for N in 1..4 no matter how many panes exist.
# Under the old flat listing the same tree was 11 rows and `3` landed on a pane
# of window 1.
