# Issue #598 follow up: the mouse wheel over pstop (a Windows htop) typed the raw
# SGR mouse report into pstop, which opened its incremental search and filled it
# with the digits of the report.
#
# Reporter larroy, 2026-09-22, on psmux 3.3.8 (66cf613 2026-08-18) with pstop 0.5.4:
#   "scrolling with the mouse wheel over pstop still corrupts the terminal /
#    triggers the same garbage-input behavior as before"
#
# Measured on 66cf613, one wheel notch at the pane centre, capture-pane:
#
#   Search: 64;61;15M[<64;61;15M[<64;61;15M_  Not found
#   EscCancel F3Next S-F3Prev F10Quit
#
# That is `ESC[<64;61;15M` read as typed characters.  pstop is a Win32 RECORD
# reader: it calls ReadConsoleInput and consumes INPUT_RECORDs, so a mouse report
# delivered as VT bytes arrives as a run of KEY_EVENTs, one per character.
#
# Two things had to be true for pstop to come out clean, and only the pair fixes it:
#
#   1357bc1 (#598)  a mouse report is only written to a pane whose application
#                   actually enabled a mouse protocol (tmux input-keys.c:805,
#                   `if (m->ignore || (s->mode & ALL_MOUSE_MODES) == 0) return;`).
#                   pstop DOES enable one, so this gate forwards for pstop and is
#                   not by itself what saves it.
#   dc6ff84 +
#   36bbaf7 (#623)  psmux no longer forces ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT on a pane
#                   whose child reads INPUT_RECORDs.  Without this the wheel reached
#                   pstop as conhost's VT translation, which is the garbage above.
#
# The pane must stay sane: pstop's function key footer stays "F1Help F2Setup
# F3Search...", never "EscCancel F3Next S-F3Prev", and no SGR report text appears
# anywhere on the screen.
#
# Layers: E2E with a real attached client, real WriteConsoleInput MOUSE_EVENT
#         wheel records, capture-pane content assertions, and the wheel gate's own
#         decision read back out of PSMUX_MOUSE_DEBUG.
