# `codepoint-widths`: tmux's server option for overriding how many columns a
# Unicode codepoint occupies (options-table.c, parsed by
# utf8_add_to_width_cache in utf8.c, applied by utf8_width).
#
# psmux resolves East Asian AMBIGUOUS characters to width 1, exactly as tmux
# does. When the user's OUTER terminal draws them as two columns instead, the
# two disagree about where every following cell on the row starts and cells get
# stranded. That is the mechanism reproduced while investigating issue #639,
# whose reporter saw leftover glyphs after quitting `tig` -- whose commit graph
# is drawn with precisely those ambiguous width characters. This option lets an
# affected user tell psmux to agree with their terminal.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT PROVES, AND WHY IT PROBES THE WAY IT DOES
#
# `show-options` echoing a value back proves nothing, so every assertion here
# is on RENDERED output from a live server.
#
# The probe is line WRAPPING. A pane $COLS columns wide holds $COLS ambiguous
# characters per row at width 1, but only $COLS/2 of them at width 2, so the
# row the text wraps on is a direct readout of the width psmux assigned. That
# decision is made by psmux's own emulator, which is what we are testing.
#
# Deliberately NOT probed here: overwriting one half of a wide glyph and
# checking the other half went with it. The pane's child runs under a ConPTY,
# and conhost has its OWN width opinion (it draws U+2502 as one column
# regardless of this option), so it repaints the line by its own geometry
# before psmux ever sees the bytes. Such a test would measure conhost, not
# psmux. That contract is asserted at the grid level instead, with no ConPTY in
# the way, by tests-rs/test_codepoint_widths.rs -- see
# overwriting_the_lead_half_clears_the_continuation and its siblings there.
# This is the same split tests/test_issue639_wide_char_clear.ps1 documents.
