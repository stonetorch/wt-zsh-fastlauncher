<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Test terminal state cleanup after TUI app exit inside psmux.
  
  Verifies that after a TUI app (pstop, opencode, claude, fake-crash TUI)
  exits, the psmux terminal is fully restored:
  - No garbled mouse escape sequences in the output
  - No TUI content remnants from alternate-screen apps
  - Shell prompt is visible and responsive
  - Typing produces correct output
  - Arrow-key cursor navigation works (visual matches actual)
  
  Root cause being tested: the Ctrl+C handler must NOT prematurely exit the
  alternate screen -- it must let the TUI app flush its own cleanup sequences
  via the reader thread.  Premature exit causes the TUI's final output to
  corrupt the primary grid.

# Wait for a real TUI app to take over the pane, and for the shell to come back

# about ten seconds to draw its first frame on this machine, so a 750ms sleep sent
# Ctrl+C while the shell was still launching it. The app then started AFTER the
# interrupt and kept running, leaving the pane with no prompt and failing every
# check that followed. Given time to start, Ctrl+C exits it cleanly.

    #   1. the shell prompt is gone from the WHOLE pane, not just the last line

    #
    # Condition 2 is what makes this reliable. A TUI clears the screen the moment
    # it starts, so for the first several seconds the pane is BLANK: the prompt is
    # already gone but the app is not up yet. Checking only "the last line is not
    # a prompt" was satisfied by that blank screen and declared the app ready
    # after about a second, which sent Ctrl+C straight into opencode's startup.
    # Measured lifecycle: blank at t+3s and t+6s, first frame at t+9s, and once
    # it is really up Ctrl+C returns the prompt within 3 seconds.

    # So this checks what psmux owes: either the session is up and fully usable,

    # A returned prompt is owed only by a run whose shell survived: when

    # app in an isolated namespace, polled every 200 ms:
    #
    #   opencode  prompt back at ~250 ms, shell PROCESS and session both gone at
    #             7.3 to 7.7 s, 4 of 4

    # the seven second teardown that takes the shell belongs to opencode, and
    # psmux ending a session whose last pane's child exited is correct tmux
    # behaviour.
    #
    # The old code sampled has-session once, right after the prompt returned,
    # and committed to the "still usable" branch. When the teardown landed in

    # and two assertions failed on output that could never appear (the sweep of
    # 2026-09-19 and 2 of 3 reruns). Nothing is pre-committed now: the usable

    # After interrupting opencode the SHELL sometimes exits, which ends the
    # session. That is opencode's teardown, not a psmux defect, and psmux ending a
    # session whose last pane's shell exited is correct tmux behaviour. Evidence:
    #
    #   * psmux's Ctrl+C decision is byte for byte IDENTICAL in the runs where the
    #     shell survives and the runs where it does not. With PSMUX_MOUSE_DEBUG=1
    #     all four runs log the same three lines:
    #         console mode=0x0006 PROCESSED_INPUT=false fg_is_shell=false
    #         raw-mode non-shell foreground: deliver raw 0x03, skip CTRL_C_EVENT
    #     so psmux never broadcasts a console event here, it only writes raw 0x03.
    #   * Polled at 100ms, the SHELL dies first and the server follows 1ms later
    #     (484ms vs 485ms), which is the ordering of "last pane exited, so the
    #     session ended", not of something killing the server.
    #
    # Asserting "the shell must survive two Ctrl+C" therefore asserts something
    # about opencode. What psmux owes is checked instead: if the session is still
    # up it must be fully usable, and if the shell exited the session must be gone
    # CLEANLY rather than left wedged or half alive.
    # Not pre-committed, for the reason measured in Group 4: opencode's teardown
    # lands about seven seconds after the interrupt, so a single has-session
    # sample here can read true and then false a second later.
