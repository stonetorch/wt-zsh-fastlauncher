# load-buffer -w clipboard propagation tests
#
# Real tmux 3.2+ uses `load-buffer -w` to forward the loaded buffer to the
# outer terminal's system clipboard via OSC 52. psmux runs on Windows and
# has direct access to the Win32 clipboard, so `-w` should write the buffer
# contents to the system clipboard.
#
# Bug: psmux's `load-buffer` handler swallowed `-w` as a no-op, so
# clipboard-aware tools (tuicr, neovim's `+` register via tmux, lazygit, ...)
# silently produced no clipboard effect inside psmux panes.
#
# These tests use:
#   * `-L lb_w_test` for namespace isolation so they never touch your real
#     psmux server.
#   * The locally-built psmux binary (target/release first, then target/debug)
#     so the tests verify the change under development.
#   * Snapshot+restore of the host's Win32 clipboard so the developer's
#     clipboard contents survive the test run.
