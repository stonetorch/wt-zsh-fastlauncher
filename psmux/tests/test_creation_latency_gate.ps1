# test_creation_latency_gate.ps1 - the regression gate on how long it takes to
# get a usable pane.
#
# WHAT THIS PINS
#
# Creating a window or a split used to be bimodal: about 15ms when a spare shell
# was claimed and 470 to 630ms when the spare pool had been drained and not yet
# refilled. Measured on master (8615957), ten back to back `new-window` calls
# came out
#
#   15, 470, 15, 476, 31, 488, 15, 520, 31, 504 ms
#
# which averages to a forgettable 257ms and feels like a stutter every other
# time you press the key. An average hides that completely, so this gate asserts
# the SHAPE of the distribution, not its centre: HOW MANY of the ten creations
# are slow (see $SlowBudget), with p90 and max as backstops.
#
# WHY IT IS MEASURED THIS WAY
#
#   - "Ready" means a PROMPT IS VISIBLE in the new pane, not that the command
#     returned. `new-window` returns in well under a millisecond while the pane
#     behind it can still be blank for half a second; timing the command would
#     score the defect as perfect.
#   - Readiness also requires THE ACTIVE PANE ID TO HAVE CHANGED. A split that
#     is refused for lack of room leaves the old pane active with its prompt
#     already on screen, so a prompt match on its own would record a refusal as
#     a 16ms creation. Every sample here is proof a pane was really created.
#   - Commands and polls go over one short lived TCP connection each (~1ms round
#     trip) rather than through the CLI (~30ms of process spawn per poll), so
#     the numbers are the server's behaviour and not the client's.
#   - Splits kill the pane they just created before the next one, because a
#     30 row window has room for only three vertical splits and every later one
#     would be refused.
#
# WHAT ELSE IS TIMED HERE
#
#   variants     the split flags the deep cells do not cover: -f, -b, -bh, -bv
#                and a split that carries its own command. Five samples each
#                rather than ten, because these are shape checks on flag
#                handling and not the distribution study the three deep cells
#                are. Verified on 2026-09-22 against the installed 0bcc421 that
#                every one of them really creates a pane and really moves the
#                active pane id, so none of these samples can be a refusal
#                recorded as a fast creation.
#   sessions     new-session to a visible prompt, twice: once with the warm
#                server pool allowed to serve the claim and once with
#                PSMUX_NO_WARM=1 so the client has to cold spawn a server. The
#                difference between the two rows IS the warm pool's value, and
#                it is the number that disappears first when the claim breaks.
#   kill         how long it takes to get RID of things: kill-pane and
#                kill-window until the pane or window is really gone from
#                list-panes / list-windows, and kill-session until the port
#                anchor file is gone, which is the point at which the server
#                process has actually exited rather than merely promised to.
#
# THRESHOLDS THAT DO NOT FLAP
#
# This gate used to assert only the tail: how many of ten creations were slow,
# p90, and max. Measured on 2026-09-22 against the SAME installed binary
# (0bcc421) on the same machine, once quiet and once with five sibling agents
# building:
#
#   quiet   new-window  p50  25 ms  p90 110 ms  max  474 ms   slow 3/30  PASS
#   loaded  new-window  p50  35 ms  p90 794 ms  max 1781 ms   slow 8/30  FAIL
#
# Nothing about psmux changed between those two runs. The p50 moved by 10 ms
# because it is the warm pool's own path; the tail moved by a factor of four
# because a creation that has to wait out a cold pwsh start waits out whatever a
# cold pwsh start costs on a busy machine, and no multiplexer can be faster than
# the shell it is starting. So:
#
#   p50 per cell is the HARD gate, always. It is the statistic the pool
#   controls, and the defect this file exists for (no pool at all) puts it at
#   400 ms and over, four times the budget.
#
#   the tail assertions (slow count, p90, max) are hard when the machine was
#   QUIET during the run and are recorded as warnings when it was not. The load
#   is sampled with \Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time around every cell and
#   written into the JSON, so a warning is auditable: a reader can see whether
#   the tail was the product or the afternoon.
#
# Runs in its own `-L` namespace and kills only that namespace, so it cannot
# disturb sessions the developer is using.

# spawn that new-window and split-window never pay. The warm pool exists to
# take that spawn off the critical path by having a server already booted and
# waiting to be claimed. PSMUX_NO_WARM=1 turns the claim off, so the two rows
# here are the same work with and without the pool and the GAP BETWEEN THEM is
# what the pool is worth. A regression that breaks the claim closes that gap,
# and closing it is visible in the trend long before either row crosses a
# budget.

# ── memory and CPU, the cost of holding a session open ────────────────────
#
# The latency cells above run DETACHED, so they have a server and no client.
# This cell attaches one, because "what does psmux cost" is a question about
# both processes, and takes four samples:
#
#   at prompt            one window, one pane, prompt up, nothing typed
#   idle after prompt    CPU over a quiet window, as a percentage of ONE core.
#                        This is the busy polling detector: a 1 ms sleep loop
#                        that Windows rounds up to a 15.6 ms timer tick is
#                        invisible in every latency number and obvious here.
#   after N windows      working set and private bytes once $ResourceWindows
#                        windows and $ResourceSplits splits are stacked up, ie
#                        what a real working session costs, plus the CPU those
#                        creations consumed
#   idle after N windows the same quiet window again, with everything open. A
#                        per pane poll shows up as a number that grew with the
#                        pane count while the first idle sample looked fine.
#
# RECORDED, NOT GATED. The thresholds on these numbers live in
# test_perf_vs_terminals (T6 memory, T7 idle CPU, T8 keystroke CPU); inventing a
# second set here would mean two places to argue with. The one assertion is that
# the section produced data, because a JSON full of nulls that still says PASS
