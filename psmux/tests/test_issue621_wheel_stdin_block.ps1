# Issue #621: "Mouse-wheel scroll stops working while a program is blocking on a
# stdin read" (psmux 3.3.8, 66cf613).
#
# Report: inside `psmux new -s test`, run a script that prints 40 lines and then
# calls `input()`.  While that read is blocked the wheel no longer scrolls back;
# it "begins to cycle the prompt history and flicker the cursor".  Ctrl+C the
# script and the wheel works again.  Keyboard copy mode (prefix + [) is fine
# throughout.  Reproduced with several languages, so the trigger is the blocked
# read, not Python.
#
# ROOT CAUSE.  psmux's wheel fallback carried a general alternate-scroll branch:
# any pane whose foreground was a CONFIRMED non-shell process had every wheel
# notch translated into three arrow-key presses written straight into the pty
# (window_ops.rs at 66cf613):
#
#     } else if non_shell_fg && !is_legacy_pager {
#         // General alternate-scroll: arrow keys (tmux DECSET-1007 parity).
#         let seq: &[u8] = if up { b"\x1b[A" } else { b"\x1b[B" };
#         for _ in 0..3 { crate::input::write_key_seq(pane, seq); }
#     } else if up && app.scroll_enter_copy_mode {
#         enter_copy_mode(app);            // <- never reached while python runs
#
# A program blocked on `input()` IS the pane's foreground process, and it is not
# a shell, so `non_shell_fg` is `Some(false) -> true` and the wheel took the
# arrow branch instead of copy mode.  The arrows land in a Windows cooked read
# (ENABLE_LINE_INPUT, measured 0x01F7 while `input()` blocks against 0x01E4 at
# the PSReadLine prompt), and the console's own line editor reads Up/Down as
# "recall the previous/next history entry" -- exactly the reported prompt-history
# cycling and cursor flicker.  Ctrl+C makes pwsh the foreground again,
# `non_shell_fg` goes false, and copy mode comes back.
#
# TMUX PARITY.  tmux's default WheelUpPane binding (key-bindings.c:510) is
#
#     if -F '#{||:#{alternate_on},#{pane_in_mode},#{mouse_any_flag}}' \
#         'send -M' 'copy-mode -e'
#
# Not one of those three terms is "the foreground process is not a shell", and
# alternate-scroll (DECSET 1007) applies to ALTERNATE-screen panes only.  A
# main-screen program blocked on a canonical read gets copy-mode scrollback in
# tmux no matter what it is doing with stdin.
#
# FIX.  The blanket arrow-key branch was removed (PR #548, merged 6ff92a4, three
# days after the 3.3.8 release commit): forwarding is decided by the pane's own
# terminal state (`pane_wheel_forward`: alternate screen, or a mouse protocol the
# application itself enabled), and everything else falls through to copy mode.
# `more.com` stays as an exact one-name allowlist because it parses no escape
# sequences at all.
#
# Layers: real attached client, real MOUSE_EVENT wheel injection, copy-mode
#         state, capture-pane scrollback, byte-exact proof that the blocked read
#         received the typed line and nothing else, and Win32 TUI verification.
