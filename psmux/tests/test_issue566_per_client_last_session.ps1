# Issue #566 claims 1 and 3: `switch-client -l` resolved through a single
# data-dir-global `last_session` file that EVERY client attach overwrites with
# the session being ENTERED. Its "not the current session" filter then
# guaranteed that the only value able to survive was one written by a DIFFERENT
# client, so -l relocated this client into a session it had never visited,
# chosen by whoever attached most recently anywhere on the machine. And
# `#{client_last_session}` was aliased to the CURRENT session, so it could
# neither predict what -l would do nor verify what it did.
#
# The fix records the session a client came FROM on that client's own registry
# entry, reported on the attach handshake (only the client process spans both
# sides of a switch, since psmux runs one server per session).
#
# EVERYTHING runs in ONE script invocation on purpose: an attached client
# launched with Start-Process is killed when the tool call that spawned it ends,
# which would otherwise produce a misleading "no server running".
