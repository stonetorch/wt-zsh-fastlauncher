# Keystroke to screen latency gate.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES
# ----------------
# The time from a key record landing in an attached psmux client's console input
# buffer to the echoed character appearing in that console's screen buffer. Both
# timestamps come from one QueryPerformanceCounter inside one process
# (tests/keylat.cs), so there is no cross process clock skew and no polling
# granularity in the number.
#
# The pane runs tests/echo_load_child.cs, not a shell. A shell means PSReadLine,
# which redraws the whole edited line per keystroke and adds about 15ms that
# psmux cannot touch; including it would bury the thing this gate exists to
# protect. The echo child writes every byte it reads at a fixed screen position,
# so the oracle watches one cell and the whole number is psmux's own path:
#
#   console input -> client -> socket -> server loop -> ConPTY write ->
#   echo read -> parser -> frame push -> socket -> client parse -> render
#
# SECOND CELL: THE SAME PATH WITH A REAL SHELL IN THE PANE
# -------------------------------------------------------
# The echo child cannot catch a regression that only appears when the pane runs a
# shell, and users run shells. So a second cell puts `pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile` in
# the pane and measures the identical oracle.
#
# That cell CANNOT be gated on an absolute number. With pwsh in the pane the
# dominant term is not psmux at all: conhost serialises PSReadLine's redraw to
# the pseudoconsole output pipe in two frames, the first carrying only the
# cursor-hide and the second, ~15ms later, carrying the character. Measured four
# independent ways on one machine, commit 203ee90:
#
#   tests/conpty_echolat.cs, a pseudoconsole host with NO psmux in it at all,
#   pwsh in the pty                                  15.78ms median
#       (char in the first read chunk: 0 of 40 trials; the 6 byte cursor-hide
#        chunk arrives at 0.61ms, the character 15.2ms later)
#   keylat against the PANE's own conhost screen buffer under psmux, ie
#   PSReadLine's own handling with nothing downstream of it
#                                                     0.55ms median
#   keylat against the attached psmux client, pwsh pane
#                                                    16.45ms median
#   psmux's own pty_trace, same run: pty write to the read that carries the
#   character 15.2ms, and every hop after it (parse, frame build, socket,
#   client parse, client pick up) 0.34ms in total
#
# So the shell cell is gated on psmux's OWN HOPS, the last row above, split out
# of every keystroke with the server's pty trace in the same run (see
# Get-PerfShellSplit in perf_metrics_common.ps1). That is the part psmux owns,
# and it is the part a regression would move. Until 2026-09-30 the gate took
# end to end minus the conpty_echolat floor instead, which was the same thing
# while both sat at ~15.7ms; that day the standalone floor fell to ~11.1ms
# while pwsh in a psmux pane stayed at ~15 for an old and a new build alike,
# and the subtraction started charging psmux ~4.5ms of timer state. The floor
# is still measured and still judged, against the pane shell's own echo time,
# so psmux making the SHELL wait (a reply it answers late) cannot hide inside
# the split.
#
# WHY A GATE AND NOT A BENCHMARK
# ------------------------------
# Every hop on that path has at some point been a poll rather than an event, and
# each time the symptom was the same: a median that looked fine and a tail that
# was a multiple of some timer interval. A threshold on the median alone would
# have passed all of them. So this asserts both:
#
#   median < 10ms   the path is event driven, not waiting on a tick
#   p99    < 25ms   no hop falls back to a timer under any sample
#
# WHAT THESE DEFAULTS DO AND DO NOT CATCH
# ---------------------------------------
# Measured on the development machine, 3 runs of 40 keys pooled, against the
# commit that made the server loop and the client wake on events and took the
# process-table walk off the event loop:
#
#   before   median 3.86ms   p90 5.48ms   p99 8.66ms
#   after    median 1.85ms   p90 2.68ms   p99 3.79ms
#
# Both of those are inside 10 and 25. So these defaults are a product floor, not
# a guard on that specific change: reverting it would still pass them. They are
# deliberately loose because this number is measured on whatever machine CI or a
# developer happens to be using, and a tight threshold on a loaded box reports a
# product failure that is not there.
#
# To pin the change instead of the floor, run it with thresholds between the two
# rows above, which was verified to fail "before" on both assertions and pass
# "after" on both:
#
#   pwsh -File tests\test_keystroke_latency_gate.ps1 -MedianMaxMs 3 -P99MaxMs 8
#
# WHICH OF THE TWO SURVIVES A BUSY MACHINE
# ----------------------------------------
# Measured on 2026-09-22 against the SAME installed binary (0bcc421) on this
# machine, against the five quiet runs already on disk:
#
#   quiet   (5 runs)          median 1.64 to 1.71   p99 2.23 to 2.77
#   loaded  (5 agents busy)   median 3.20           p99 4.45
#   the defect, quiet         median 3.86           p99 8.66
#
# Under load the healthy median lands on top of the defect's median and the
# assertion stops discriminating; the healthy p99 is still half the defect's.
# So the P99 ASSERTION IS HARD ALWAYS, and the median assertion is hard when
# the machine was quiet and a recorded warning when it was not. The machine
# load is sampled from \Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time and goes into the
# JSON envelope, so a warning can always be checked against what the machine
# was doing. Dropping the median assertion instead was rejected: on a quiet
# machine it is the cheaper of the two signals and it reads 1.7 against a 3.0
# budget, which is not a close thing.
#
# MEMORY AND CPU RIDE ALONG
# -------------------------
# The first echo run also samples the server and the attached client: working
# set and private bytes at the prompt and again after the key burst, the CPU
# those keystrokes cost normalised to ms per 100 keys, and the CPU burnt over a
# quiet window with nothing typed. The keystroke run is the only part of this
# suite that holds a real server and a real client alive with a prompt up, so it
# is the cheapest place to take the sample. The numbers are RECORDED, not gated:
# the thresholds on them live in test_perf_vs_terminals (T6, T7, T8), and the
# only assertion here is that the section produced data at all, because a JSON
# full of nulls that still says PASS is worse than a failure.
#
# SAMPLES ARE KEPT
# ----------------
# Every sample is written to %USERPROFILE%\.psmux-test-data\metrics as JSON, so a
# regression can be compared against the run that last passed instead of against
# a number in a comment. Never inside the repo. Each file carries the shared
# envelope from tests/perf_metrics_common.ps1: the git sha of the tree the
# binary was built in (or "installed"), the binary path, the machine name and
# the CPU model, so two files can be compared without guessing what produced
# them. tests/perf_summary.ps1 prints the trend across them.
