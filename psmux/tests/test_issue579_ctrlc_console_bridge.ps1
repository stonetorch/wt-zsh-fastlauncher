# Issue #579: Ctrl+C exits WSL instead of sending SIGINT inside psmux.
#
# Root-cause class (proven by mechanism emulation + measurement):
#   send_ctrl_c_event guarded its GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(CTRL_C_EVENT, 0)
#   broadcast with a classification of ONE deepest foreground leaf resolved by
#   a highest-PID-child walk.  The broadcast hits EVERY process on the pane
#   console.  A broadcast into a console holding a Cygwin/MSYS shell (Git
#   Bash, MSYS2) is lethal to wsl.exe: the shell's runtime hard-kills the
#   native children its own bookkeeping tracks (issue #491's mechanism), and
#   that bookkeeping is invisible to Windows PPID walks (MSYS fork stubs exit,
#   severing the PPID chain - measured: intact seconds earlier, severed by
#   Ctrl+C time).  Windows PIDs are also not monotonic, so the leaf walk can
#   descend the wrong sibling subtree and classify a shell while wsl.exe is
#   live, which fires the lethal broadcast.
#
# Fix: after AttachConsole, enumerate the console's REAL membership via
# GetConsoleProcessList and skip the broadcast when any member is a VT bridge
# (wsl/ssh) or a Cygwin/MSYS unix shell.  The raw 0x03 the call site writes is
# all tmux ever delivers, and a Cygwin shell's own pty machinery turns it into
# SIGINT for its foreground work, natives included.
#
# The arms below assert the VALIDATED behavior matrix on the fixed build.
# Deliberately NOT asserted: a backgrounded `wsl.exe -e sleep &` job dying to
# Ctrl+C in a Git Bash pane - that is native MSYS behavior, reproduced
# identically in plain conhost Git Bash with no psmux involved.
