# Regression: `new-session -d` must not return until its initial window is
# listable (tmux's "command finished server-side" semantics).
#
# ROOT CAUSE: the server writes its .port file and starts accepting connections
# BEFORE it creates the initial window. A readiness gate that waited only for the
# port file + a TCP connect could return exit 0 while list-windows was still
# empty: a window-less session that callers and scripts then trip over.
#
# DETERMINISTIC RED via fault injection: the server sleeps
# PSMUX_TEST_WINDOW_DELAY_MS right before create_window (after .port + accept
# thread are up). Set longer than the client RPC read timeout (2000ms) so an
# un-gated client loses. The fixed client polls until the window is listable.
# Removal recipe: delete this test if the PSMUX_TEST_WINDOW_DELAY_MS hook is
# removed from server/mod.rs.
