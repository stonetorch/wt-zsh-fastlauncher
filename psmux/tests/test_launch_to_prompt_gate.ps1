# test_launch_to_prompt_gate.ps1: launch to usable prompt, psmux vs bare pwsh
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES
#   The only startup number a user feels: how long after launching until the
#   pane's shell is sitting at its first prompt. The shell itself writes the
#   finish line. marker.ps1 stamps QueryPerformanceCounter (system wide on
#   Windows, so it is directly comparable to the harness's Stopwatch) into a
#   file as the last thing it does before -NoExit drops it to a prompt. The
#   start line is a Stopwatch stamp taken immediately before Start-Process.
#
#   Two arms, interleaved so machine drift hits both equally:
#     bare   pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -File marker.ps1 <out>
#     psmux  psmux -L <ns> new-session -s <n> <that same command line>
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#   psmux used to route every multi-word pane command through
#   `<default-shell> -Command "<cmd>"`. On Windows the default shell is pwsh,
#   so that wrapper was a SECOND full PowerShell start (and, lacking
#   -NoProfile, it also sourced the user's profile the inner -NoProfile had
#   asked to skip): a measured 278ms of launch latency on top of a gap that was
#   already ~250ms. try_direct_spawn now execs a bare program name with
#   arguments directly, which is also what tmux does with a multi-argument
#   shell-command. This gate keeps that wrapper from coming back.
#
# THE MARGIN
#   What is left after the fix is psmux's irreducible cold-start work plus the
#   ConPTY tax. Measured hop by hop with PSMUX_STARTUP_TRACE, n=14 medians on a
#   32 core box that was busy with other builds at the time (so the absolute
#   numbers are high; the SHARES are what this list is for):
#     ~16ms  client argv parse, warm claim attempt, server spawn call
#     ~51ms  the server process (psmux.exe again) loading to main
#      ~2ms  panic hook, AppState, priority, the single-server mutex
#      ~2ms  TcpListener::bind
#     ~23ms  the session registry: .key .sid .pid, the namespace instance
#            token, the server marker, .port - six small files, several ms
#            apiece with realtime AV scanning, and their ORDER is load bearing
#            (#496, #509) so they are not free to move off the critical path
#      ~8ms  CreatePseudoConsole
#    ~173ms  CreateProcessW into the pseudoconsole. This is the console connect
#            handshake with conhost, not psmux code, and it is the single
#            largest hop; the warm pane pool exists because of it, which is why
#            a SPLIT is ~25ms and a cold new-session is not
#    ~540ms  pwsh's own init, which is slower through ConPTY than in a console
#   psmux therefore owns roughly 100ms of a cold launch (two exe loads plus the
#   registry); everything else is the shell and the operating system.
#
# THE GATE IS A RATIO, NOT A DIFFERENCE
#
#   An absolute delta cannot be a gate on a machine that is sometimes busy,
#   because BOTH arms stretch when the machine is busy and the difference
#   between two stretched numbers stretches with them. Measured on this machine
#   against the same installed binary (0bcc421) on 2026-09-22:
#
#     quiet    bare 393 ms   psmux  625 ms   delta 232 ms   ratio 1.59
#     loaded   bare 892 ms   psmux 1374 ms   delta 482 ms   ratio 1.54
#
#   Nothing about psmux differed between those two rows. The delta doubled and
#   would have failed a 400 ms gate; the ratio moved by three percent. Across
#   the five previous recorded runs the ratio sat between 1.56 and 1.62, and
#   the loaded run above is inside that band.
#
#   So the HARD gate is the ratio, budgeted at $MaxRatio. The defect this file
#   exists for put a whole second pwsh start (~278 ms) on top of a gap that was
#   already ~250 ms, which on a quiet machine is 393 -> ~921 ms, a ratio of
#   2.34; and because the ratio does not move with load, it is over the budget
#   on a busy machine too.
#
#   The absolute delta is still asserted, because it is the number a human
#   reads, but as a LOAD AWARE assertion: a hard failure when the machine was
#   quiet during the run and a recorded warning when it was not. The machine
#   load is sampled with \Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time and written into
#   the JSON, so a warning can always be checked.
#
# MEMORY AND CPU
#   A launch number on its own cannot tell a build that got there faster from a
#   build that got there by burning the machine, so the last psmux iteration is
#   also sampled: the working set, private bytes, CPU and thread count of the
#   server and of the attached client at the moment the pane's shell reached its
#   prompt, and then a quiet window with nothing driving the session, reported as
#   a percentage of one core. Same helpers and same field names as the creation
#   and keystroke gates (tests\perf_metrics_common.ps1), so a row from this file
#   lines up with a row from those. The server is found by its <ns>__<session>.pid
#   anchor, never by image name: this machine routinely has a dozen psmux servers
#   belonging to other sessions, and a warm standby shares this binary and this
#   namespace.
#
# Samples are written to %USERPROFILE%\.psmux-test-data\metrics\, never the repo.
