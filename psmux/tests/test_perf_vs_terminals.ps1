# test_perf_vs_terminals.ps1 - psmux measured AGAINST the real terminal
# emulators installed on this machine, not against numbers quoted from docs.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
# ---------------------
# tests/test_perf_vs_wt.ps1 prints Windows Terminal figures that were read out
# of WT's source code. Nothing in it ever launched WT. This suite launches
# every terminal that is actually installed, runs the SAME shell inside each of
# them, and measures the four things the user feels:
#
#   1. launch to prompt        how long from "open a terminal" to a live shell
#   2. keystroke to screen     how long from a key going in to the echo showing,
#                              against the ConPTY floor measured in the same run
#   3. memory and CPU          what the psmux server, the psmux client and the
#                              host terminal cost while that shell sits there
#   4. creation latency        new-session, new-window, split-window -v and -h
#
# Hosts: bare pwsh in its own console, Windows Terminal, WezTerm, Alacritty,
# psmux attached in its own console, and psmux inside Windows Terminal (which
# is how most psmux users actually run it). A host that is not installed is
# reported SKIP and costs nothing.
#
# HOW TO READ THE NUMBERS
# -----------------------
# LAUNCH TO PROMPT. Every cell runs the identical shell:
#     pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -File <marker.ps1> <markerfile>
# marker.ps1 writes [Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::GetTimestamp() and its own $PID to
# the marker file. QPC is system wide, so the suite subtracts its own
# GetTimestamp() taken immediately before Start-Process and gets a sub
# millisecond, host neutral "the shell is up" instant with no polling tax and
# no screen scraping. The marker is written just BEFORE pwsh paints its first
# prompt, so these numbers exclude the host's own first paint. They are a shell
# readiness measure, identical in every cell, which is what makes the cells
# comparable. The marker also hands back the shell's PID, which is how the
# keystroke and resource sections find the console to work on.
#
# The GUI hosted cells (WT, WezTerm, Alacritty, psmux in WT) go through one
# extra `cmd /c wrapper.cmd` hop, about 15 ms, so the wrapper can pin the
# child's environment: a `wt -w <name>` window is spawned by the Windows Terminal
# monarch process and would otherwise inherit ITS environment, not this
# suite's, which would send a psmux pane at the user's real data dir. The hop
# is present in all four GUI cells and absent in the two directly launched
# cells, so GUI to GUI comparisons are exact and the two direct cells are, if
# anything, flattered by about 15 ms.
#
# Windows Terminal is normally already running, so a `wt` window opens inside an
# existing process while WezTerm and Alacritty cold start a whole GUI process.
# wt_was_running in the metrics JSON records which case was measured. The bench
# window is named, so after the first repetition each Windows Terminal cell is a
# new TAB in that window, which is both the common user action and the only
# shape that can be reliably closed again.
#
# The launch cells are INTERLEAVED: repetition 0 of every host, then repetition
# 1 of every host, and so on. This machine drifts by a factor of two inside a
# minute, so running five repetitions of Windows Terminal and only then five of
# psmux would compare two different machines. Round robin puts every cell in
# the same weather, which is what makes psmux minus WT a number worth having.
#
# KEYSTROKE TO SCREEN is measured by tests/keylat.cs at the PTY level: a key
# record is written into the target console's input buffer and the same process
# watches that console's screen buffer for the echo, both timestamped from one
# QueryPerformanceCounter, so there is no cross process clock skew.
#
# THE HOST ROWS AND THE PSMUX ROWS ARE TAKEN AT DIFFERENT PROBE POINTS, and that
# is the whole explanation for "1 ms versus 18 ms". For Windows Terminal, WezTerm
# and Alacritty the console being watched is the pane conhost's screen buffer,
# which is UPSTREAM of the pseudoconsole pipe, and it also contains none of the
# terminal's own GPU paint (another 8 to 16 ms of frame time in each of them).
# For the psmux cells the console being watched is the psmux CLIENT's own
# console, DOWNSTREAM of that pipe, so the psmux number contains the whole psmux
# pipeline AND the pipe itself.
#
# The pipe is the expensive part and it is not psmux's. Traced by perfE on
# 2026-09-10: PSReadLine paints a keystroke in two console writes, conhost's
# pseudoconsole serializer emits the first as a 6 byte ESC[?25l chunk after about
# 0.6 ms, and then withholds the chunk carrying the character for a further
# 14.7 ms. The character sits in the pane conhost's screen buffer the whole time.
# Every ConPTY consumer on Windows pays this, Windows Terminal included; the host
# cells here simply do not measure the part of the path where it happens. At the
# SAME probe point as the host cells, psmux measures 0.55 ms against the 1.03 ms
# measured here for Windows Terminal.
#
# So the psmux rows are judged against the floor, not against the host rows and
# not against a number invented in a brief: tests/conpty_echolat.cs hosts a
# pseudoconsole with the same shell and the same key record and no psmux at all,
# it runs in the SAME run on the SAME machine. T3a and T3c used to assert how far
# above its median and p99 psmux sits (0.74 ms median, 1.57 ms p99 at the time);
# they now judge psmux's own hops split out per keystroke (1.7 to 1.8 ms median
# on 2026-10-01), and the floor is held against the pane shell's echo time (T3d).
#
# MEMORY AND CPU ride along with the keystroke section, because that is the only
# section that holds one cell alive long enough to watch it. For every cell the
# suite finds the processes that make that cell work and samples each of them
# twice, at prompt ready and again after the keystroke run:
#
#   server        the psmux server for this cell's session, identified by the
#                 <ns>__<session>.pid anchor file, not by image name, so a warm
#                 standby or another agent's psmux is never mistaken for it
#   client        the psmux CLI client attached to that session
#   shell         the pwsh being typed into, identical in every cell
#   host          the terminal emulator hosting the cell, found by walking the
#                 shell's parent chain to the first GUI process. For a Windows
#                 Terminal TAB that process is the user's existing WT, shared
#                 with their own windows, so host_shared is recorded true and
#                 its working set is NOT this cell's cost. Its CPU delta still
#                 is, because the other windows are idle.
#   console_host  the conhost or OpenConsole that owns the cell's console
#
#   memory   WorkingSet64 (what is resident) and PrivateMemorySize64 (what is
#            not shared with any other process) in MB.
#   cpu      TotalProcessorTime delta across the keystroke run, normalised to
#            ms of CPU per 100 keystrokes, so cells with different key counts
#            stay comparable.
#   idle cpu TotalProcessorTime delta over a quiet window (-IdleSeconds, 3 s by
#            default) with nothing typed, as a percentage of ONE core. This is
#            the busy polling detector: a 1 ms poll loop shows up here as
#            percent of a core burnt for nothing, and it is invisible in every
#            latency number in this file.
#
# CREATION LATENCY is measured against a detached psmux server over one
# persistent control connection: a dump-state round trip costs about 0.15 ms,
# so prompt detection is effectively continuous instead of the 16 ms per poll
# that a fresh `capture-pane` client costs. Each figure includes the roughly
# 16 to 20 ms Windows needs to start the psmux.exe CLI client, because that is
# what a user scripting psmux actually pays. These cells use the DEFAULT pane
# shell so the warm pane pool is in play, which is why they are bimodal: a
# claimed spare shell lands near 60 ms and a cold shell start near 500 ms. The
# suite flags that explicitly instead of burying it in a mean.
#
# Each measured window is killed again the moment its sample is taken. That is
# not tidiness, it is the measurement: every window left behind grows the
# dump-state frame the control connection has to read and re-scan on every
# push, and the 2026-09-10 run that left twenty windows standing reported
# 9 to 14 SECOND "creations" that were really the harness reading its own
# backlog. Killing the window keeps the frame at one or two windows, which is
# the shape a user's session actually has.
#
# THRESHOLDS, and where they come from
# ------------------------------------
# Set from the measured data on the reference machine (Ryzen AI MAX+ 395,
# Windows 11 26200, PowerShell 7) on 2026-09-10 while sibling build and
# benchmark agents were saturating the CPU. These are LOADED numbers; a quiet
# machine is faster. Medians and n>=5 per cell are used for that reason.
#
#   T0  every cell that was NOT skipped produced data. A run that prints a
#       pretty summary full of dashes is worse than a failing run, because it
#       looks like a pass. This is checked as a threshold so an empty section
#       fails loudly.
#   T1  psmux attached launch to prompt, minus bare pwsh, <= 350 ms, as an
#       ABSOLUTE DELTA and no longer as a 1.5x ratio. A ratio moves when bare
#       pwsh moves, and bare pwsh ranges from 350 to 600 ms here depending on
#       what else the machine is doing, so the same build scored 1.7x and 2.5x
#       on two runs with its own cost unchanged. The delta is what psmux owns:
#       the client, the server, the ConPTY and the warm claim. Measured 175 to
#       213 ms on master after the double shell fix, against 440 to 530 ms for
#       the bug that fix removed, so 350 ms still catches that regression.
#       T1 is the cold server cell, T1b the steady state one, same budget.
#   T2  psmux inside WT must not add more than 300 ms over plain WT, again in
#       the steady state. The owner proposed 300 ms for one number, but the
#       data shows two populations: with a server already running psmux adds
#       the client, a warm claim and a ConPTY, while the first psmux window of
#       the day additionally pays a cold server spawn (about 215 ms measured
#       separately in docs/performance.md). So 300 ms is applied to the steady
#       state and the cold case gets its own budget, T2b at 700 ms.
#   T3  psmux keystroke to screen. T3a: psmux's own hops per keystroke, median
#       <= 2.5 ms, T3c: their p99 <= 6 ms, both split out of end to end with
#       the server's pty trace in the same run (since 2026-10-01; before that
#       they were end to end minus the standalone ConPTY floor, which broke when
#       the floor moved with the machine's timer state, see section 2). T3d:
#       the pane shell's own echo time under psmux at most 7 ms over the floor.
#       T3b keeps an ABSOLUTE p99 ceiling of 25 ms so the total a user waits is
#       still bounded. A cell whose trace does not split is reported only.
#       The old absolute 10 ms median could not pass with a shell in the pane
#       and no psmux change could make it: 15.8 of those 18 ms are conhost's
#       pseudoconsole serializer. The budgets are about three times the measured
#       overhead, which is loose enough for the floor's own spread and tight
#       enough that a regression costing one 15.6 ms timer tick cannot hide.
#   T4  new-window and split-window p90 < 300 ms, first session < 1000 ms.
#   T5  zero leftover windows, tabs, shells or servers. Not a warning: a
#       benchmark that litters the desktop is a benchmark nobody will run.
#   T6  memory for ONE pane: psmux server working set <= 60 MB and psmux
#       client working set <= 60 MB. Measured here at 14 to 25 MB each, so the
#       limit is deliberately 2x the measurement: it is a regression alarm for
#       a leak or an unbounded scrollback, not a tuning target to shave. A
#       whole session of server plus client under 120 MB is also the number
#       that matters against "a multiplexer is heavy" as an argument.
#   T7  psmux idle CPU <= 3 percent of one core, server and client summed, over
#       the SETTLED quiet window with nothing typed. Two windows are measured per
#       cell: the first, half a second after the last keystroke, is the adaptive
#       poll ramping down and is reported but never judged; the second, taken
#       after a further settle, is the one T7 reads. tmux on Unix is ~0 percent
#       idle; a Windows port that polls is the known failure mode (and psmux
#       really did ship 1 ms sleeps that Windows rounded to 15.6 ms per timer
#       tick), so this is the one number that catches a regression no latency
#       test can see. Resolution: TotalProcessorTime moves in 15.6 ms ticks, so
#       one tick in a 3 s window is 0.52 percent of a core; the gate is 4 ticks.
#   T8  keystroke CPU cost <= 3000 ms of CPU per 100 keystrokes, server and
#       client summed, ie 20 ms of CPU per key. Measured 1060 ms per 100 keys on
#       a quiet machine and up to 1680 ms loaded, and the cause is FRAME COUNT,
#       not spinning: because conhost emits the cursor hide chunk and the text
#       chunk about 15 ms apart, psmux builds and pushes TWO frames per keystroke
#       at a shell prompt, the second superseding the first, at roughly 4 to
#       5.7 ms of work per frame. A pane that writes one chunk per key costs one
#       frame and about half the CPU. The follow up, which wants its own change
#       and its own sweep, is to defer a cursor-visibility-only frame by a short
#       grace so the text frame absorbs it. The client's CONSOLE HOST costs more
#       than either psmux process, 5100 to 5500 ms per 100 keys, and is reported
#       in the table but never judged: it is a legacy console window repainting
#       per write batch, and inside Windows Terminal that work is someone else's
#       GPU.
#
# CLOSING WHAT IT OPENS
# ---------------------
# Every window, tab, shell and psmux client is closed by PID the moment its
# measurement is captured, before the next cell starts, and the rule is
# ATTRIBUTION: a process is only ever killed when this run can show it started
# it. Three mechanisms, in order of strength:
#
#   1. PIDs this suite spawned itself, and the shell PID its marker reported.
#   2. Any cmd, pwsh or psmux process carrying this run's scratch directory on
#      its command line. That path contains this suite's own PID, so nothing
#      outside this run can match. This is what closes a `wt` tab whose launch
#      timed out: the tab is hosted by the wrapper cmd.exe, the tab lives
#      INSIDE the Windows Terminal process, so there is no marker to name the
#      shell and no new GUI process to reap either.
#   3. Terminal and console host processes attributed to a cell: a GUI process
#      of the cell's own host name that did not exist before the cell started,
#      or a conhost/OpenConsole whose parent is one of this run's processes or
#      the GUI process this cell opened. A console host is never killed while a
#      real client is still attached to it, because then it is somebody's live
#      window; it is reaped once its clients are gone.
#
# What T5 counts as a leftover is therefore what a user would have to close:
# a window, a tab, a shell, a psmux server. A console host that has outlived
# its client has no window of its own, so it is reaped and listed rather than
# failing the run. One that still holds a real client is a leftover and does
# fail it.
#
# What it will NOT touch, ever: this script's own process ancestry (pwsh <-
# claude.exe <- pwsh <- WindowsTerminal and the console host that WT owns for
# it), every terminal process that existed before the run, and any psmux that
# is not running THIS binary in one of THIS run's two -L namespaces.
#
# THE BUG THIS REPLACES, because it is worth knowing about. The 11:11 and 11:59
# runs on 2026-09-10 failed T5 with "leftover" WindowsTerminal and OpenConsole
# PIDs the suite had never opened, and they killed them. Two faults compounded:
# the baseline snapshot was built with `foreach ($n in $GuiNames)` at script
# scope, where $n IS the [int]$N parameter, so every iteration threw a
# conversion error on stderr and the baseline stayed EMPTY; and the audit then
# counted every process of those names that was not in the (empty) baseline as
# something the suite had opened, and killed it. The result was a benchmark that
# ended by killing the user's Windows Terminal, which is where the agent running
# it lived, which is why those runs also have empty result sections. Attribution
# plus the baseline assertion below is why neither half can happen now.
#
# The run ends with an audit that counts what it failed to close and fails T5.
#
# Exit code is the number of failed thresholds. A metrics JSON with every
# sample lands in %USERPROFILE%\.psmux-test-data\metrics\ (never in the repo),
# and it is written after EVERY section, with "complete": false until the run
# finishes, so a run that is killed half way still leaves its data and says so.
#
# Isolation: an isolated PSMUX_DATA_DIR, two per run -L namespaces, and only
# PIDs this suite started are ever killed.

# -LoadSensitive marks a threshold that is a DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO TIMINGS,

# The cells are INTERLEAVED: repetition 0 of every host, then repetition 1 of
# every host, and so on. Running five repetitions of Windows Terminal back to
# back and only then five of psmux makes the comparison hostage to whatever the
# machine was doing during each block, and this machine drifts by a factor of
# two within a minute. Round robin puts every cell in the same weather.
#
# Two namespaces are in play. The COLD psmux cells live in their own namespace
# that is torn down after every repetition, so each of their repetitions pays a
# real server spawn. The WARM cells live in the namespace with the anchor
# session, so a psmux server and a warm standby are always there, which is the
# steady state a user meets after the first window of the day. Separate
# namespaces are what let the two be interleaved instead of run in blocks.
#
# A repetition whose marker never arrives is RETRIED once. A single missed
# marker used to cost the whole cell its sample, and a cell with no samples is
# a dash in the summary table; one retry turns a transient miss back into data.

    # WHY THIS IS A DELTA AND NOT AN ABSOLUTE NUMBER.
    # The old T3a asked for a 10 ms median and could never pass with a shell in
    # the pane, because about 15.8 ms of the number is conhost's pseudoconsole
    # serializer withholding the chunk that carries the character, and no change
    # to psmux can remove it. Traced and quantified by perfE on 2026-09-10: the
    # character is in the pane conhost's screen buffer 0.6 ms after the keystroke,
    # the pipe delivers it 14.7 ms later, and tests/conpty_echolat.cs measures
    # that floor at 15.72 to 15.85 ms with no psmux in the path at all. psmux's
    # own contribution above the floor is 0.74 ms median and 1.57 ms p99. At the
    # same probe point as the host cells, psmux measures 0.55 ms against the
    # 1.03 ms reported here for Windows Terminal.
    # So the budgets are 2.5 ms on the median and 6 ms on the p99, which is about
    # three times the measured overhead: enough headroom for the floor's own run to
    # run spread, tight enough that a psmux regression costing a whole 15.6 ms
    # timer tick cannot hide. The absolute p99 ceiling stays at 25 ms so the total
    # a user waits is still bounded, and a 30 ms median ceiling takes over if the
    # floor probe itself fails.
    #
    # SINCE 2026-10-01 T3a and T3c JUDGE PSMUX'S OWN HOPS, not end to end minus
    # the floor. On 2026-09-30 the standalone floor fell from ~15.7 to ~11.1 ms
    # on this machine while pwsh inside a psmux pane kept taking ~15 ms from
    # psmux's pty write to the read carrying the character, for an old and a new
    # build alike (interleaved A/B, identical to 0.1 ms). The subtraction then
    # charged psmux ~4.5 ms of machine timer state. So every psmux cell runs
    # with PSMUX_PTY_TRACE on and each keystroke is split with the server's own
    # stamps (Get-PerfShellSplit in perf_metrics_common.ps1): psmux's hops are
    # end to end minus the pane shell's echo time. The budgets are unchanged and
    # now stricter in effect, because the old subtraction hid about 1 ms of
    # shell time inside the "overhead". The floor still takes part: T3d holds
    # the pane shell's own echo time against it with a margin wider than the two
    # timer states sit apart (~4.5 ms) and narrower than the extra 15.6 ms tick
    # psmux would cost by answering a shell query late, which a split alone
    # cannot see. A cell whose trace did not split is reported end to end only
    # and says so; its floor subtraction is not judged.

# A PERSISTENT control connection is a PUSH channel: the server sends a whole
# frame whenever a pane changes. Three things follow, and getting any of them
# wrong costs seconds on the very measurement being taken.
#
# First, do NOT poll with dump-state. Every dump-state makes the server
# serialise a fresh frame, so a tight poll loop both saturates the server that
# is trying to boot the shell being timed AND queues a frame per request on top
# of the pushes. Reading the pushes is free: they arrive exactly when the pane
# changes, which is exactly when the prompt lands. One dump-state is still sent
# as a nudge if nothing has arrived for a while, so a prompt that was already on
# screen is still seen.
#
# Second, read the socket RAW. A StreamReader keeps its own buffer, so
# NetworkStream.DataAvailable can say "nothing pending" while a complete frame
# sits unread inside the reader, and the loop then works on a stale frame
# forever.
#
# Third, and this is the one that cost a whole section: the server answers every
# `dump-state` with a two byte `OK` line, and those acks are INTERLEAVED with the
# state frames on the same socket. A reader that keeps "the newest line" (or that
# queues lines and drains to the last, which is the same thing) therefore throws
# the state frame away and hands the caller `OK` instead. Measured on
# 2026-09-10: 604 "frames" seen in 30 s, every single one of them 2 bytes long,
# and the creation section reported nothing at all. A state frame is a JSON
# object, so lines are classified: one starting with "{" is a frame and is kept
# as the newest frame, anything else is a protocol reply and is kept separately
# for the AUTH handshake. Keep the parse LINEAR too, newest frame only: the
# earlier frames are stale by definition, and the previous version's
# StringBuilder.ToString() per extracted line was quadratic in the frame, which
# is how a run with twenty windows standing came to report 9 to 14 SECOND
# creations that were really the harness re-reading its own backlog.
