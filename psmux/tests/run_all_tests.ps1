# ── Abort channel: stop a run WITHOUT needing the runner window ──────────────
#
# WHY A FILE AND NOT JUST Ctrl+C: the suites launch attached psmux clients in
# their own consoles, and those windows TAKE THE FOREGROUND within seconds of a
# run starting. Measured 2026-08-26 by sampling GetForegroundWindow every 300ms
# across a -Only tui_proof run: the runner console held focus for 2 seconds, a
# psmux.exe window took it, and the runner never got it back. Ctrl+C is only
# delivered to the console that HAS focus, so for most of a multi-hour run the
# runner console is simply not reachable from the keyboard. The only exit left
# was killing pwsh from Task Manager, which skips the summary and strands every
# psmux server the in-flight suite had started (measured: 3 orphans).
#
# So the abort signal is a FILE any other shell can create:
#     tests\stop_tests.cmd     (or: New-Item $env:TEMP\psmux-teststop.flag)
# It is polled once a second inside the per-suite wait loop and again before
# each suite starts, so an abort lands within ~1s even in the middle of a 900s
# perf suite, and nothing further is started.
#
# Ctrl+C still works when the window IS reachable, but it is now routed through
# the same flag instead of killing the process. The native handler installed
# here runs BEFORE PowerShell's own (handlers fire in reverse registration
# order) and returns TRUE to swallow the event, so the runner survives long
# enough to kill the suite's process tree, tear down psmux and print the report
# for everything that did run.

# ── Desktop hygiene: console windows a suite leaves behind ───────────────────
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR
# After three full sweeps the desktop held about 33 Windows Terminal windows,
# most with six dead tabs each, hosting 121 processes whose command line was
# exactly `C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c pause`, every one of them parked at
# "Press any key to continue", plus the launcher windows sitting at their own
# final pause. On Windows 11 every new console is delegated to Windows Terminal,
# so each of those is a visible tab or window a human has to click away.
#
# They are not descendants of any suite: the runner puts each suite in a Job
# Object with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE, and the job kill had already run. Anything
# created outside that job (a process that breaks away, or one whose PTY host
# died and left the child orphaned on a real console) survives it. The root
# cause of that particular batch was traced to a Rust test helper that spawned
# `cmd.exe /c pause` dummies under a pseudoconsole and relied on the PTY master
# drop to end them, which it does not, but the runner must not depend on knowing
# the culprit: ANY suite that leaks a console window is a defect, and the run has
# to say which suite did it rather than leaving a pile of anonymous dead tabs.
#
# SO THE RULE IS: a suite may open windows, but it must close them. After each
# suite the runner diffs the desktop against a snapshot taken before it, logs
# what is new with its parent chain, ends it, and closes the window.
#
# WHY A PROCESS SNAPSHOT *AND* A WINDOW SNAPSHOT
# A Windows Terminal window hosts many tabs and exposes ONE window handle, so a
# handle cannot be mapped back to the tab's process. The process snapshot is what
# catches the carrier; the window snapshot is what catches a window whose process
# is already gone (a dead tab) and proves the desktop is actually back to
# baseline. Neither alone is sufficient.
#
# WHAT IS NEVER TOUCHED
#   - every pid in this runner's own ancestry, and the pid that owns this
#     console's window (killing that is how a sweep used to take down the
#     terminal it was launched from),
#   - every window handle that already existed when the run started,
#   - any window whose title matches $script:AuditProtectTitles, and any handle
#     listed in PSMUX_AUDIT_PROTECT_HWND (a comma separated list), which is how a
#     caller pins the window its own session lives in,
#   - WindowsTerminal.exe is never killed as a process. It hosts tabs that are
#     not ours; its windows are closed politely instead.

#
# MEASURED DEFECT THIS FIXES (run 2026-09-12_00-54-17)
# The audit reported the runner's own launcher window as a leftover:
#     LEFTOVER-WINDOW test_perf_vs_terminals hwnd=17698570 pid=13928
#                     class=CASCADIA_HOSTING_WINDOW_CLASS title=[Administrator: cmd]
# and then politely closed the window the run was printing into. Three separate
# protections all failed to catch it:
#   - GetConsoleWindow() returns the INVISIBLE pseudoconsole host window for a
#     console that Windows 11 delegated to Windows Terminal, so the handle it
#     pinned (2031992) was not the visible window at all;
#   - the owner pid is useless, because one WindowsTerminal.exe owns many windows:
#     the runner's window and the user's own window were BOTH pid 13928;
#   - the title filter did not match, because at the moment of the audit the
#     window was showing "Administrator: cmd", not the launcher's title.
#
# So the runner stamps a unique marker into its own console title and finds the
# window displaying it. That is identity rather than inference, and it works the
# same for a classic conhost window and a delegated Terminal window. The title is
# then restored to something a human can read which ALSO matches the protected
# title list, so the window stays protected even if the marker is overwritten.
