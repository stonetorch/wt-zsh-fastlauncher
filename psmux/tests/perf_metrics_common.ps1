# perf_metrics_common.ps1 - the pieces every perf gate needs, in one place.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# --------------------
# Four suites time psmux and every one of them wrote its own JSON with its own
# field names. A run recorded in one file could not be lined up against a run
# recorded in another, and none of the gate files recorded WHICH BUILD produced
# the number: two of the three gates default to the psmux on PATH, the third
# defaults to target\release, and the JSON said only "binary". Comparing a
# suspected regression against last week meant guessing.
#
# So every perf JSON now carries the same envelope:
#
#   schema        the envelope version, so a reader can tell old files apart
#   suite         the suite that wrote it
#   timestamp     round trip "o" format, local time with offset
#   binary        full path of the psmux under test
#   git_sha       short HEAD of the repository the binary was built in, found by
#                 walking up from the binary, or "installed" when the binary
#                 does not sit in a work tree (a cargo install copy does not)
#   machine       computer name
#   os / cpu / cpu_count / ram_gb
#   load          what else the machine was doing: percent of TOTAL cpu busy,
#                 sampled from \Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time, with every
#                 sample a suite took during the run summarised as n/min/p50/max
#
# WHY THE LOAD BLOCK EXISTS
# -------------------------
# The owner's machine routinely runs five or six agents building and testing at
# once, and a creation that is served by a warm spare in 17 ms on a quiet box
# takes 35 ms on a box at 60 percent, while the one creation in ten that has to
# wait out a cold pwsh start goes from 470 ms to 1780 ms. Measured here on
# 2026-09-22 with five other agents building:
#
#   quiet  (2026-09-21 18:41)  new-window  p50 25 ms  p90 110 ms  max  474 ms
#   loaded (2026-09-22 22:19)  new-window  p50 35 ms  p90 794 ms  max 1781 ms
#
# The p50 barely moves because it is the pool's own path. The tail is the
# machine. A JSON that does not say which of the two it was recorded cannot
# tell a regression from a busy afternoon, so the load goes in the envelope and
# a gate may consult it before it decides whether a tail is a failure.
#
# and the same shapes for numbers: Get-PerfStats returns n/min/p50/p90/p99/max/
# mean, and the resource helpers return working set, private bytes and CPU in
# one shape for the server and the client alike.
#
# MEMORY AND CPU
# --------------
# The server is found by its <ns>__<session>.pid anchor file, never by image
# name: a warm standby shares the image and the namespace but never the anchor,
# and the owner's machine routinely has a dozen psmux servers belonging to other
# sessions. The anchor holds "<pid>:<creationtime>" so a recycled PID is
# rejected. Clients are the processes running THIS binary with this namespace on
# their command line that are not the server.
#
# Nothing in this file kills anything. It only reads.
#
# Dot source it:  . "$PSScriptRoot\perf_metrics_common.ps1"

# 3 added the `load` block to the envelope. Everything schema 2 carried is still
# carried under the same names, so a schema 2 file and a schema 3 file line up
# field for field and perf_summary.ps1 reads both.
$script:PerfSchema = 3

# ── splitting a shell keystroke into the shell's part and psmux's part ──
#
# With pwsh in the pane, keystroke to screen is two terms in series: the time
# the pane's own shell and conhost take to put the echo on the pseudoconsole
# output pipe, and every psmux hop around it (client, socket, server loop, pty
# write, and after the read: parse, frame, socket, client draw). Only the second
# is psmux's. The first is a PSReadLine redraw that conhost serialises in two
# frames with a timer wait between them, and how long that wait lasts depends
# on the machine's timer state, not on psmux.
#
# That is why a floor measured in ANOTHER pseudoconsole host is not a like for
# like baseline on its own. Measured 2026-09-30 on one machine, same minutes:
# the standalone host (tests/conpty_echolat.cs) read 11.1ms while pwsh in a
# psmux pane took 15.0ms from pty write to the read carrying the character; on
# every earlier day both read about 15.7. Neither psmux build moved it: an A/B
# of 39ac085 against 99bfd9e, three interleaved pairs, agreed to 0.1ms, and a
# later run caught the pane itself at 11.8. Subtracting a floor that sits in a
# different timer state from the pane reported 4 to 5ms of "psmux overhead"
# that psmux never spent.
#
# So the shell cell runs with PSMUX_PTY_TRACE on and splits every keystroke
# with the server's own QPC stamps (src/pty_trace.rs): `w` is psmux finishing
# the pty write of the key, and the first `r` after it whose visible text holds
# the character is the pane's echo coming back. shell = r - w, and
# psmux = (appear - inject) - shell, per keystroke, on one clock (QPC is system
# wide, and keylat logs its QPC base).
