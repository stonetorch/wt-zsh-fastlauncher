# Issue #686: the warm pool's surge spawns were serialised, and kill-server
# leaked the spares that were still in flight.
#
# WHAT WAS REPRODUCED (worktree build of master d18b389, ten `new-window` back
# to back on one session, PSMUX_WARM_TRACE=1):
#
#   pool: spawned spare pane=4  in  44.8ms
#   pool: spawned spare pane=5  in  69.7ms
#   pool: spawned spare pane=6  in 124.8ms
#   pool: spawned spare pane=9  in 180.6ms
#   pool: spawned spare pane=10 in 239.9ms
#   pool: spawned spare pane=7  in 302.3ms
#   pool: spawned spare pane=8  in 345.0ms
#   pool: spawned spare pane=11 in 397.9ms
#
#   Eight spawns started together and each cost about 55ms more than the one
#   before it, because every ConPTY spawn held the process console state lock
#   for the whole of its CreateProcessW. A claim arriving while the queue had
#   landed nothing waited for the next landing, which is where the stalls came
#   from: per call 31 18 19 41 453 535 47 83 546 50.
#
#   And: three rounds of "new-session -d, six new-window back to back,
#   kill-server immediately" left orphan `pwsh` pane shells whose parent psmux
#   was gone, each holding a conhost, idle forever. Six over ten rounds.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS
#
#   1. CONCURRENCY. Spawns whose lifetimes overlap must cost about the same.
#      The serialised build is not visible as "slow", it is visible as a
#      staircase: eight spawns that all START together and finish one whole
#      CreateProcessW apart. So the assertion is on the SPREAD of the costs of
#      spawns that overlap in time, which was ~322ms serialised and is under
#      30ms concurrent, and does not depend on how fast this machine is.
#
#   2. The user visible number that follows from it: the p50 of a ten call
#      burst. This one is a guard rather than the discriminator, because the
#      serialised build's p50 was 57ms with the damage in its tail. It is here
#      because the first attempt at the fix, unserialising the spawns with no
#      cap on how many run at once, took the p50 to 251ms: eight concurrent
#      spawns are slow enough that every claim cold spawns and retires the
#      batch in flight. Under 110ms means neither failure is present.
#
#   3. ZERO orphan pane shells after a kill-server with a surge in flight.
#      Orphans are counted only as pwsh children of the server pid THIS suite
#      started, so a sibling psmux on the machine is never miscounted and never
#      touched.
#
# Set PSMUX_TEST_BIN to test a non-installed binary.
# Run: pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\test_issue686_pool_surge_and_reap.ps1
