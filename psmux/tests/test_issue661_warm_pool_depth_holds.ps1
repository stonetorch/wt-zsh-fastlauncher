# Issue #661: "split-window p99 is ten times its p90 on a session that only
# splits" - the spare pool is retired in the middle of a run of creations.
#
# WHAT WAS REPRODUCED (40 `split-window -v` on one live session with one
# attached client, ~265ms apart, worktree build of master 37e2990, trace on):
#
#   [12736.402] claim(split): pane=31 spare_age=2046.2ms pool_left=7 ready_left=6
#   [12839.661] pool: surge over, trimmed 6 surplus spare(s) back to target=2
#   [12840.356] pool: sample depth=2 ready=2 inflight=0 target=2 eff=2
#   [13002.912] claim(split): pane=32 spare_age=2056.4ms pool_left=1 ready_left=1
#   [13267.629] claim(split): pane=33 spare_age=2055.7ms pool_left=1 ready_left=0
#
#   Six settled spares were killed 103ms after one split and 160ms before the
#   next, while the user was still splitting. From there the pool alternated one
#   ready spare with none and the visible latency of a split went from ~20ms to
#   120-580ms: p50 125.6, p90 482.7, p99 581.6, max 581.6 over the 40.
#
#   The cause is the surge window: it was only ever written by a claim that
#   MISSED, so a run the surge was serving well renewed nothing and the window
#   counted down from a miss six seconds in the past.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, from the pool's own trace rather than from timings alone
#   * no spare is retired BETWEEN the first and the last creation of a run
#   * the sampled depth never falls below the configured target mid run
#   * no claim older than the leading edge window (1500 ms from the first
#     claim, the time the surge's spares need to boot) finds NO READY SPARE
#   * and the user visible numbers that follow from all three: how many splits
#     are slow, and the max
#
# The depth samples come from `pool: sample depth=..` lines, written four times
# a second under PSMUX_WARM_TRACE (src/server/mod.rs, #661). Only the SESSION
# server's lines are read: the `__warm__` standby writes to the same file and is
# capped at one spare by design, so counting its samples would fail every run.
#
# Set PSMUX_TEST_BIN to test a non-installed binary.
# Run: pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\test_issue661_warm_pool_depth_holds.ps1
