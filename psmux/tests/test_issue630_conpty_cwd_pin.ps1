# Issue #630 "Split pane's ConPTY host pins source directory, blocking deletion"
#
# Splitting a pane used to leave the new pane's conhost.exe parked in the split's
# start directory for the pane's whole life. The directory could then not be
# deleted for as long as the pane lived, even after its shell had cd'd away:
#
#   Remove-Item: The process cannot access the file
#   'C:\Users\...\Temp\psmux-i630-446977\X' because it is being used by another
#   process.
#
# MEASURED cause. Reading RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS.CurrentDirectory out of the
# PEB of every psmux descendant, on the unfixed binary, after `split-window -c X`
# and after the split pane's shell had moved to a neutral directory:
#
#   74632  psmux     ...\neutral
#   12120  conhost   ...\neutral      (pane 0's host, at the server's cwd)
#   24484  pwsh      ...\neutral
#   21756  conhost   ...\X       <==  the split pane's host, stuck in X
#   74528  pwsh      ...\neutral      (the split pane's shell, correctly moved)
#
# The server wrapped pane creation in env::set_current_dir(start_dir).
# CreatePseudoConsole() spawns the pane's conhost.exe from the server process, so
# the host inherited that directory and held a handle on it. A console host has
# no `cd`, so it never let go. The pane's shell was ALSO given the same directory
# explicitly (lpCurrentDirectory on CreateProcessW for a cold spawn, an injected
# cd for a warm transplant), so the server chdir was pure damage. It is gone.
#
# tmux parity: tmux chdir()s inside the forked child only, so the pane's own
# process is the single holder of the start directory and it releases it on the
# first cd. That is what is asserted below: the pane still STARTS in the
# requested directory, and once its shell leaves, nothing psmux owns keeps it.
#
# The matrix runs twice, because the two spawn paths differ completely:
#   warm  - the pane is transplanted from the pre-spawned standby pool and
#           re-homed with an injected cd (this path was already correct)
#   cold  - PSMUX_NO_WARM=1 forces a fresh ConPTY per pane (this is the path
#           that reproduced the bug)
#
# NOT asserted here, because it is deliberate and documented in src/server/mod.rs:
# the server adopts the SESSION's start directory as its own Win32 cwd and keeps
# it for life, so that new-window/split-window without -c inherit it. A session
# therefore holds its own start directory. That is the "host sits at the server's
# cwd" behaviour the reporter described as acceptable, and it pins one directory
# per server rather than one per split.
#
# SAFETY: fully isolated. Unique -L socket namespace, PSMUX_DATA_DIR pointed at a
# throwaway temp root, sessions killed by name, and any surviving server killed
# only when its executable path is the binary under test.
