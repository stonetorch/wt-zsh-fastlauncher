# Issue #597 (follow up): what happens to a reply psmux cannot inject.
#
# A reporter on Windows 10 19045 measured every reply psmux injects into a pane
# arriving as zero bytes, while the replies ConPTY answers itself (DA1, DSR)
# arrived normally.  Their mouse debug log carried one line:
#
#     [platform] send_bracketed_paste: AttachConsole(18572) FAILED err=5
#
# and never a success.  Two things in that report could not be followed up from
# a modern host, and both are fixed here rather than guessed at.
#
# 1. The log did not say whether the FreeConsole immediately above the attach
#    had taken.  err=5 is ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED, which AttachConsole returns both
#    when the caller still holds a console and when the target console refuses
#    the caller, and nothing in the line told those apart.  The attach now
#    reports the detach result, the console before and after it, the target's
#    liveness, image, parent and token, both processes' integrity, and the OS
#    build, and retries once behind a second verified detach.
#
# 2. The colour path was documented as falling back to the pane's input pipe
#    when injection fails, and the reporter saw the reply still not arrive.
#    Measured here by writing each reply shape straight into a live pane's
#    ConPTY input pipe and dumping the child's stdin on build 26200:
#
#       "A"                               -> "A"
#       CSI ESC [ ? 997 ; 1 n             -> byte exact
#       OSC ESC ] 4 ; 2 ; rgb:... ESC \   -> nothing at all
#       DCS ESC P > | tmux 9.9.9 ESC \    -> a bare ESC, body eaten
#
#    So the pipe carries a CSI reply and not an OSC one, which is why the
#    colour path injects at all, and a DCS on the pipe is worse than lost
#    because a lone ESC is an Escape keypress to whatever reads the pane.  The
#    OSC pipe write is gone on Windows when a child pid was known, the
#    XTVERSION reply deliberately never gained one, and both now log the loss.
#
# The failure is driven by PSMUX_FAKE_INJECT_FAIL=1, which points every console
# attach at a process id that does not exist, so the attach fails for real and
# the whole failure path runs.  Documented in docs/diagnostics.md.
