# Regression: `new-session -d` must WAIT for a slow-but-healthy server instead of
# giving up (and orphaning it) on a tight fixed timeout.
#
# ROOT CAUSE: under load a healthy server can be slow to write its .port file.
# The pre-fix client allowed only a 5s .port poll then a single 100ms connect,
# mistook anything slower for death, exited rc=1, and even deleted the .port
# file -- orphaning a live server. (38/6000 under load, every one an orphan.)
#
# DETERMINISTIC RED via fault injection: PSMUX_TEST_PORTFILE_DELAY_MS makes the
# server sleep before writing .port while otherwise healthy (its listener is
# already bound). Set LONGER than the old 5s poll, so the pre-fix client gives
# up while the server is alive and about to be ready. The fixed client keeps
# waiting (bounded), the server comes up, and new-session returns rc=0 with a
# listable window -- and crucially leaves NO orphan.
# Removal recipe: delete this test if the PSMUX_TEST_PORTFILE_DELAY_MS hook is
# removed from server/mod.rs.
