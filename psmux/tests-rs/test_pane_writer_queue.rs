// Regression tests for the per-pane writer thread fix (39c9f8a).
//
// Writing to a pane used to go straight to the ConPTY input pipe from the
// server loop. That pipe has a fixed 64KB buffer, so a pane child that
// stopped reading stdin made write_all block the single server thread,
// wedging every session. The fix routes every pane write through
// `spawn_pane_write_queue`: a per-pane queue drained by a dedicated thread,
// mirroring tmux's libevent bufferevent contract — writes complete
// immediately, stay ordered, and absorb backpressure in memory. The thread
// exits cleanly when the queue side is dropped with the pane.
//
// These tests wrap a dummy writer (no PTY, no spawn) and observe the queue
// contract: immediate completion, order preservation, and clean teardown.
