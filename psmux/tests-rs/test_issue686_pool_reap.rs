// Issue #686, half two: `kill-server` leaked the spares that were still in
// flight.
//
// The pool can only kill what it owns. A surge hands eight spawns to
// background threads, and each of those is a real `CreateProcessW` some
// milliseconds before its `WarmPane` reaches the server loop. `kill-server`
// landing in that window killed the windows and the pooled spares and then
// called `process::exit`, which stops the spawner threads where they stand:
// the shells they had just created stayed alive, parented to a dead psmux,
// each holding a conhost, idle at a prompt. Measured on the pre fix build:
// six orphan `pwsh` over ten rounds of "new-session, six new-window,
// kill-server".
//
// These tests cover the bookkeeping that fixes it: a spawn is tracked from the
// moment it is ISSUED, gains its pid as soon as `CreateProcessW` returns one,
// is released when the server takes ownership, and is drained by the teardown
// reaper. The end to end proof is tests/test_issue686_pool_surge_and_reap.ps1.
