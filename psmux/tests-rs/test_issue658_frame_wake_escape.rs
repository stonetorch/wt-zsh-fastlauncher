//! Issue #658: a frame wake must not jump over the held Escape's deadline.
//!
//! `InputSource::read_timeout` waits on console input and a pushed frame
//! together. Its loop ends with an `esc.expire()`, and that expire is the ONLY
//! thing that releases a lone Escape once its 50 ms coalescing window is up -
//! the console arm cannot do it, because a lone Escape is precisely the case
//! where no further console event arrives. The frame arm left the loop through
//! an early `return`, so it jumped straight over the expire. While frames kept
//! arriving, which is what a busy pane does, nothing released the key.
//!
//! This pins the decision the frame arm now makes. The E2E side of it is
//! tests/test_issue658_escape_under_output.ps1.
