// Issue #687: a keyboard selection in copy mode yanks a different range than
// the one the client painted, whenever the view has been scrolled.
//
// Reported against the keyboard route: select whole lines with `V`, move down,
// press Enter, and the text that lands in the buffer is not the text that was
// highlighted.  It runs off the bottom of the buffer instead.
//
// Root cause, introduced by b957aa6 ("selection: pair each column with its own
// row, and carry each end's scroll offset"):
//
//       let anchor_abs = anchor.0 as i64 - anchor_scroll as i64;
//     - let cursor_abs = pos.0 as i64 - current_scroll as i64;
//     + let cursor_abs = pos.0 as i64 - app.copy_pos_scroll_offset as i64;
//
// That commit fixed a real mouse defect: a drag that hits a pane edge scrolls
// the view AFTER the endpoint was recorded, so the endpoint has to keep the
// offset it was measured at.  The endpoint's offset is written in nine places
// and every one of them is a mouse handler.  Nothing on the keyboard route
// writes it: not `enter_copy_mode`, not `v` / `V` / `o`, not a cursor motion,
// not a `send-keys -X` verb, and `CopyModeState` does not carry it across a
// pane switch either.  It therefore stays 0, so the endpoint is resolved
// against the live bottom of the buffer while the anchor is resolved against
// the scrolled view, and the selection is displaced by the scroll offset.
//
// Measured on the released binary with 200 numbered lines, `select-line`, two
// `cursor-down`s and `copy-selection`:
//
//     scroll-up x0     1 line    (empty)
//     scroll-up x3     3 lines   LINE198, LINE199, LINE200
//     scroll-up x10   10 lines   LINE191 ... LINE200
//
// Three lines were selected every time.  The copied range tracks the scroll
// offset and always ends at the live bottom.
//
// The fix makes the endpoint's offset an `Option`: `Some(o)` only while a drag
// has pinned it, `None` meaning "this endpoint is in the current view", which
// is what every route other than a mid drag edge scroll means.  A field that
// ninety call sites have to remember to write is the defect itself.
//
// These tests drive the REAL copy mode over a real PTY-backed pane tree (no
// psmux server and no session is created).  Registered from src/copy_mode.rs.
