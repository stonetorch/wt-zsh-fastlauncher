//! The render path must not walk the whole process table per frame.
//!
//! `#{pane_current_command}` and `#{pane_current_path}` resolve a pane's
//! foreground process, and on Windows that means
//! `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS)` — an enumeration of every
//! process on the machine (~340 on a normal desktop). Both variables are
//! expanded on the server's per-output render path, so a status bar or window
//! title referencing them took two full system walks per repaint, on the same
//! thread that delivers keystrokes to ConPTY.
//!
//! These tests assert the property that matters: the number of real walks is
//! bounded by time, not by how many times the render path asks. They count
//! actual enumerations via the thread-local `PROC_TABLE_WALKS` rather than
//! timing anything, so they do not get flaky on a loaded machine.
//!
//! Concurrency note: the *cache* is process-wide, and several other test
//! modules reach it through `#{pane_current_command}`. So a foreign thread can
//! populate the cache and turn one of our expected walks into a hit — it can
//! never cause an extra walk on our thread, because the counter is
//! thread-local. Assertions are written as upper bounds wherever a foreign
//! cache fill is possible, and as exact counts only where it is not.
//!
//! The freshness split is deliberate and is also pinned here: render-path
//! callers reuse a recent table, while the Ctrl+C and mouse-injection routers
//! always enumerate fresh, because serving them a stale process tree would
//! misroute a real keypress or click.
