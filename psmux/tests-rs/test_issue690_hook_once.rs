// Issue #690: one `select-window` fired `after-select-window` TWICE.
//
// The reproduction is four commands and a buffer count:
//
//     psmux -L h new-session -d -s s -x 80 -y 24
//     psmux -L h new-window -t s
//     psmux -L h set-hook -g after-select-window "set-buffer HOOKFIRED"
//     psmux -L h select-window -t s:0
//     psmux -L h list-buffers
//         buffer0: 9 bytes: "HOOKFIRED"
//         buffer1: 9 bytes: "HOOKFIRED"       <- one command, two firings
//
// It counted 2 on all four routes (the CLI, the raw control socket, a
// bind-key binding injected into an attached client, and the prefix `:`
// prompt), three runs each, because the doubling was on the server side of
// all of them: `select-window -t <index>` sent TWO control requests for the
// same window, a permanent `FocusWindow` from the generic `-t` focus block
// and a `SelectWindow` from the command's own arm.  Every request carries its
// own hook slot in the server loop, so each one fired the hook.  The trace
// PSMUX_HOOK_DEBUG writes named both carriers:
//
//     === FIRE after-select-window req=FocusWindow pid=3600 ===
//     === FIRE after-select-window req=SelectWindow pid=3600 ===
//
// tmux fires a command's after hook once, from the command queue:
// cmd-queue.c `cmdq_fire_command` calls
// `cmdq_insert_hook(s, item, &fs, "after-%s", name)` once, after the
// command's exec returns, and `notify_winlink("window-selected")` in notify.c
// drives the notification hooks once as well.
//
// These tests pin the rule the fix put in one function: every `select-window`
// form emits EXACTLY ONE window selecting request, and it is the right one.
// The end to end counts, on all four routes, live in
// tests\test_issue690_hook_once.ps1.
