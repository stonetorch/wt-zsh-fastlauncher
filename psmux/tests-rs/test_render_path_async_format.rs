//! The render path must expand `#()` asynchronously.
//!
//! tests-rs/test_issue272_format_shell_cache.rs already proves the async
//! contract of `run_shell_command` itself — but every one of those tests opts
//! in by constructing an `AsyncFormatGuard` by hand. That is precisely the
//! thing that broke: the guard was correct, the contract was correct, and the
//! server's auto-push block simply did not use it. A `#(cmd /c ...)` in
//! status-right therefore ran `Command::output()` synchronously on the single
//! server event loop — the same thread that delivers keystrokes to ConPTY — on
//! every pane output burst, which is up to ~1000/s while a shell is drawing.
//! Measured cost of the real-world offender: 88ms per call. The result was
//! severe, permanent keyboard lag that only appeared inside psmux.
//!
//! So these tests deliberately do NOT construct a guard. They call the render
//! helpers exactly as the server loop calls them and assert the observable
//! consequence: the call returns promptly, and N calls inside one TTL produce
//! one subprocess spawn rather than N.
//!
//! Spawn accounting is the same trick as the #272 suite: the inner command
//! appends a line to a unique file each time it really runs, so line count is
//! ground truth independent of what the expansion returns.
