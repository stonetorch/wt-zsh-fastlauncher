// Issue #672: "Warm-pane cd injection uses PowerShell syntax for full-path Git
// Bash default-shell" (TreyThomasCodes, on 3.3.8 / 66cf613).
//
// Reported line, in a Git Bash pane served from the warm pool:
//
//     $  cd 'C:\Users\trey\trading\newsletter-follower'; try { [System.IO.Directory]::SetCurrentDirectory($PWD.ProviderPath) } catch {}; cls
//     bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('
//
// with `set -g default-shell "C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe"`.
//
// That is the same defect as #600 and 3.3.8's `rehome_command` is where it
// lives: it had no shell classification at all, it picked the snippet from
// `cfg!(windows)`, so on Windows every pane got the PowerShell form whatever
// shell was running in it. `rehome_syntax_for_shell` (added for #600) replaced
// that with a classification keyed on the shell.
//
// The reporter's hypothesis was that the classification "compares the raw
// default-shell value against bare names instead of matching on the basename".
// That is the property this file pins: the answer must depend only on WHICH
// shell the value names, never on HOW it is spelled. A bare name, an absolute
// path, forward or backslashes, with or without `.exe`, any letter case, a
// quoted value and a value carrying arguments must all classify identically.
//
// tests-rs/test_issue600_bash_rehome.rs pins the wire form of each dialect;
// tests/test_issue672_gitbash_fullpath_warm_cd.ps1 drives the real panes.
