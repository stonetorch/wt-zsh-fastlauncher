// #661: the pool's depth must hold for as long as the user keeps creating
// panes, not for five seconds after the one claim that happened to miss.
//
// WHAT WAS MEASURED (40 `split-window -v`, one live session, one attached
// client, ~265ms apart, PSMUX_WARM_TRACE):
//
//   [12736.402] claim(split): pane=31 spare_age=2046.2ms pool_left=7 ready_left=6
//   [12839.661] pool: surge over, trimmed 6 surplus spare(s) back to target=2
//   [12840.356] pool: sample depth=2 ready=2 inflight=0 target=2 eff=2
//   [13002.912] claim(split): pane=32 spare_age=2056.4ms pool_left=1 ready_left=1
//   [13267.629] claim(split): pane=33 spare_age=2055.7ms pool_left=1 ready_left=0
//
// Six ready spares were killed 103ms after a split and 160ms before the next
// one, in the middle of a run of splits. `surge_until` was only ever written by
// a claim that MISSED, so a run the surge was serving perfectly renewed
// nothing, and `WARM_SURGE_HOLD` counted down from a miss six seconds in the
// past. After the trim the pool alternated one ready spare with none and the
// visible split latency went from ~20ms to 120-580ms.
//
// The decisions under test live in `WarmPool::note_claim` and are pure: what
// opens the surge window, what holds it open, and what still gives the memory
// back. The end to end numbers are in tests/test_issue661_warm_pool_depth_holds.ps1.
