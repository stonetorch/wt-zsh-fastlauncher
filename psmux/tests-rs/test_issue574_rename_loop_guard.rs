// Issue #574: "session renaming fails again in 3.3.7".
//
// The reporter runs `new-session -d` (auto-named "0") then `rename-session -t 0
// test-N` in a loop. On the 3.3.7 release the first two cycles pass and every
// cycle from the third on dies with `failed to create session '0'`.
//
// This is #505's leaked name guard, seen from a different angle. The tests in
// test_issue505_rename_session_guard.rs all follow ONE guard through its renames.
// The loop's real shape is different and is what this file covers: the name "0"
// is acquired by one owner, renamed away, and then acquired again by the NEXT
// owner, over and over. Each iteration is a separate server process taking the
// name the auto-namer just re-picked, so what matters is that the release is
// complete enough for a fresh acquirer, not merely that the original guard
// stopped pointing at it.
//
// Ownership probes run on spawned threads throughout: a Windows mutex is
// recursive for its owning thread, so an in-thread probe reports "free" even
// while this process holds the name and could never catch a stale hold.
