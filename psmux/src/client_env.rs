//! Hand a claiming client's environment to the warm server it claims (#659).
//!
//! psmux keeps a parked `__warm__` server per namespace so that the next
//! `new-session` is instant.  That standby is spawned by whichever process
//! happened to need a server first (an earlier session's server, a shell
//! started before psmux was installed, `psmux` reached through WSL interop),
//! and claiming it only renames the session: the standby's PROCESS
//! environment is whatever it was born with, forever.
//!
//! On the cold path the server is spawned by the client itself
//! (`platform::spawn_server_hidden` passes a null `lpEnvironment`, so the
//! child inherits the client's block verbatim), which makes "the server's
//! environment is the environment of the shell the user ran psmux in" an
//! invariant everything downstream relies on: `run-shell` children, hooks,
//! plugin scripts and every pane spawned later inherit it.  The warm pool is
//! an optimisation that quietly breaks that invariant, and the visible
//! symptom is a plugin that cannot find psmux itself:
//!
//! ```text
//! psmux : The term 'psmux' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, ...
//! ```
//!
//! tmux has the same class of staleness for its server-wide base environment
//! (`tmux.c:418` fills `global_environ` once, from whoever started the
//! server) and mitigates it with the `update-environment` option, applied
//! from the CLIENT's environment at new-session and attach (`environ.c:186`,
//! `cmd-new-session.c:283`, `cmd-attach-session.c:135`).  In tmux, though,
//! the server is always started by a real client, so the base environment is
//! always SOME user shell's.  psmux's warm pool is the part tmux does not
//! have, so the fix is to restore psmux's own invariant at claim time: the
//! claimed standby adopts the claiming client's environment, which is exactly
//! what a cold spawn would have given it.
//!
//! The payload travels as a Windows environment block (UTF-16LE,
//! `KEY=VALUE\0` entries, double-NUL terminated) in a file next to the warm
//! server's handoff files, because an environment is far too large and too
//! full of separators to survive the single-line control protocol.
