//! Centralised lifecycle for the warm pane.
//!
//! The warm pane is a snapshot of server state at spawn time: shell
//! binary, environment, terminal dimensions, vt100 scrollback cap.
//! When any of those change, the snapshot becomes stale.  Without a
//! single owner of "what does the warm pane need now?", each
//! invalidation site grew its own ad-hoc kill+respawn — which led to
//! gaps:
//!
//!   * `set-option default-shell` killed the warm pane but never
//!     respawned (only handled in one of two SetOption paths).
//!   * `set-option allow-predictions` was reconciled at boot only,
//!     never at runtime.
//!   * `set-option default-terminal` updated `app.environment["TERM"]`
//!     but the warm pane kept the old TERM forever.
//!   * `set-option history-limit` was not propagated at all (#271).
//!   * the host terminal palette (`PSMUX_HOST_COLORS`, planted on the child at
//!     spawn time) was never registered here at all, so a spare spawned before
//!     a client reported its colours kept an empty palette and handed it to the
//!     first window created afterwards.
//!
//! This module is the only place that decides what to do, and the
//! only place that mutates `app.warm_pane`.
//!
//! Three response kinds, in increasing cost:
//!
//!   `Noop`             — change does not affect the warm pane.
//!   `Patch(...)`       — mutate the running pane in place (cheap,
//!                         keeps the shell warm).  Used for state
//!                         that only lives in the vt100 parser.
//!   `Respawn(reason)`  — kill the child shell and pre-spawn a new
//!                         one with current `AppState`.  Required for
//!                         anything that affects the child process
//!                         (env vars, shell binary, predictions).
//!
//! `apply` honours `app.warm_enabled`: if warm panes are disabled,
//! `Respawn` degrades to a kill with no respawn.

    // between, so the real grace is about twice this. Both fit inside the
    // 1500ms the kill-server handler holds its socket open for, which is what
    // keeps the caller's force-kill fallback from cutting the shutdown short.
