        // upstream before any application has run, and PSReadLine re-enables
        // tracking on its own (#360/#548).  Measured on this tree: a pane
        // whose child had explicitly CLEARED ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT still showed
        // `?1003;1006h` in the raw pane stream.  The two signals that do mean
        // the application asked:
        //
        //   1. `mouse_proto_owner` — a DECSET transition that
        //      `update_mouse_proto_owner` attributed to a confirmed non-shell
        //      foreground.  This is the accurate signal for VT panes whose
        //      DECSET actually survives (bridges, passthrough).
        //   2. ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT on the child console RIGHT NOW.  Console
        //      input mode lives on the shared input buffer, so this reports
        //      whatever the current foreground app last asked for, which is
        //      exactly how a real Windows TUI (crossterm, ratatui, libuv)
        //      registers.
        //
        // The console query costs an AttachConsole dance (2 second cache), so
        // it is only run for the wheel, and only after the cheap
        // `mouse_proto_owner` check has already failed.  Clicks, drags and
        // motion never reach it.
        //
        // BOTH of those signals resolve to the same console input mode word,
        // and that word belongs to the console rather than to the application
        // that set it (#613).  `uv_tty_set_mode` assigns
        // `ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT | ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT` over the whole
        // word and restores nothing on exit, so ANY node process anywhere in
        // the pane's tree — a subagent, an MCP server, one tool invocation —
        // takes ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT away and makes conhost publish the loss as
        // `ESC[?1003;1006l`, which clears `mouse_proto_owner` too.  Measured
        // here: a pane whose TUI held `0x03B0` forwarded the wheel, and after
        // one `node -e "process.stdin.setRawMode(true)"` it read `0x0208` and
        // forwarded nothing, permanently, with the TUI never consulted.
        //
        // tmux cannot have this bug: its authorization is `s->mode &
        // ALL_MOUSE_MODES` on the pane's OWN screen (input-keys.c:805), set by
        // the app's DECSET and cleared only by its DECRST or a respawn.  So

///     whole subtrees into slots sized for something else (a 34/4/10 column of
///     three panes came back as 39/8/1).  Rotating the leaves, which is what a
///     cell permutation is once the cells live in the tree, leaves every
///     split's `sizes` and the tree shape alone.
///
///  2. Each moved pane is RESIZED to the cell it landed in.  psmux left every
///     pane at the size of the cell it had just left, so `pane_height` and
///     `pane_width` disagreed with `pane_top`/`pane_bottom`/`window_layout`,

///     path `resize-pane` takes, which is why `resize-pane -U 0` healed it.
///
/// `upward` is tmux's `-U`, which is also its default: the pane in the first
