//! Env gated hop trace of launch to prompt, `PSMUX_STARTUP_TRACE=<file>`.
//!
//! With the variable unset every probe is one relaxed atomic load and returns,
//! so the shipped startup path is unchanged. It exists to answer one question
//! with timestamps rather than inference: of the time between a user typing
//! `psmux new-session <cmd>` and the pane's shell reaching its first prompt,
//! which hop owns which milliseconds.
//!
//! Timestamps are raw `QueryPerformanceCounter` ticks, which are system wide on
//! Windows, so a line written by the client process, a line written by the
//! server process and a `Stopwatch` timestamp taken by a test harness can all
//! be compared directly. The header line records the frequency.
//!
//! Every process that has the variable set writes its own `<path>.<pid>`, so
//! the client's and the server's lines never interleave; merge and sort by the
//! first column to read the whole path.
//!
//! THREE PROCESSES WRITE, AND THEIR FILES MUST NOT BE MERGED BY LABEL: the
//! foreground CLI, the session server, and the warm standby server the session
//! server spawns just before its loop. All three run `main`, so all three write
//! `cli.entry`, and merging by label produces a timeline that runs backwards.
//! The client is the pid the launcher started; the session server is the one
//! that writes `srv.child.spawned`; anything else is the standby.
//!
//! Labels, in path order (`cli.` is the foreground CLI, `srv.` the server):
//!   `cli.entry`        first line of `main`
//!   `cli.dispatch`     argv parsed, about to act on the subcommand
//!   `cli.warm.claimed` a warm standby server was claimed (fast path)
//!   `cli.server.spawn` `spawn_server_hidden` returned (cold path)
//!   `cli.ready`        the readiness gate accepted the server
//!   `cli.cfgwarn`      the client read `config-warnings.log`, with what it
//!                      found. It has to land after `srv.cfgwarn` or the
//!                      warnings are lost (#706)
//!   `cli.attach`       the attach/TUI path is entered
//!   `cli.connected`    the client's socket to the server is up
//!   `srv.entry`        first line of `run_server`
//!   `srv.appstate`     `AppState::new` returned
//!   `srv.priority`     scheduling class claimed (#608)
//!   `srv.mutex`        the single-server-per-name guard is held
//!   `srv.listen`       `TcpListener::bind` returned, the port is known
//!   `srv.keyfile`      the `.key` file is on disk (it precedes `.port`, #496)
//!   `srv.reg.pid`      `.sid` and `.pid` written
//!   `srv.reg.instance` the namespace instance token is established (#509)
//!   `srv.reg.marker`   this process is claimed for the data dir (#510)
//!   `srv.bound`        `.port` written: the readiness beacon is visible
//!   `srv.config`       `load_config` returned
//!   `srv.cfgwarn`      `config-warnings.log` written, with how many
//!   `srv.pty.open`     `openpty` called
//!   `srv.pty.ready`    `CreatePseudoConsole` returned
//!   `srv.child.argv`   the pane child's argv, about to be spawned
//!   `srv.child.spawned` `CreateProcessW` into the pseudoconsole returned
//!   `srv.window`       the initial window exists
//!   `srv.prewarm`      the spare pane pool has been filled
//!   `srv.loop`         the main request loop is about to run
//!
//! The `srv.listen` .. `srv.bound` span is the session registry: six small
//! files, and on a machine with realtime AV scanning each create costs several
//! milliseconds, so the span is worth far more than its line count suggests.
//! Its order is load bearing (see #496 and #509) and is not free to shuffle.
