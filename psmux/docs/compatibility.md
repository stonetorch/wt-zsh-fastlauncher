## Recent Parity Improvements

This section covers tmux features that were recently brought to full parity.

### Case-sensitive Key Bindings

Key bindings now distinguish between lowercase and uppercase letters exactly like tmux. `bind-key T` binds to `Shift+T`, while `bind-key t` binds to lowercase `t`. This is critical for plugins like PPM (`Prefix+I` to install) and psmux-sensible (`Prefix+R` to reload).

### Ctrl+Space as Prefix

`set -g prefix C-Space` now works correctly. Previously, multi-character key names like `Space` were parsed as single character fallbacks.

### Wrapped Directional Pane Navigation

Directional pane navigation (`select-pane -U/-D/-L/-R`) now wraps at layout edges, matching tmux behavior. Navigating past the rightmost pane wraps to the leftmost, and so on. Wrap is also correctly suppressed while zoomed.

### Prefix Repeat Chaining

After pressing the prefix key, successive keypresses within the `repeat-time` window (default 500ms) each trigger the bound action without needing to re-enter the prefix. This matches tmux's repeat behavior for pane navigation and resize bindings.

### Switch Client

`switch-client` is fully functional with all standard flags (`-t`, `-n`, `-p`, `-l`). Use it to programmatically switch between sessions.

### Window Name Resolution in Targets

Target syntax now resolves window names, not just indices. `send-keys -t mysession:mywindow` correctly finds the window named "mywindow" in session "mysession".

### Manual Rename Flag

`new-window -n NAME` now sets the `manual_rename` flag, preventing `automatic-rename` from overwriting the explicitly specified window name with the foreground process name.

### List Commands from Within Session

Commands like `list-panes`, `list-windows`, `list-clients`, `list-commands`, and `show-hooks` now work when run from within a psmux session (via `Prefix + :`). Output is displayed in a temporary overlay.

### Source File from Within Session

`source-file` works from within a live session via `Prefix + :`. Previously, config changes only took effect after detaching and reattaching or killing the server.

### Display Panes Overlay

`display-panes` (and `Prefix + q`) now shows pane numbers briefly and auto-dismisses after `display-panes-time` (default 1s). Type a number during the overlay to switch to that pane.

### Hook Deduplication

`set-hook -g` now replaces existing hooks on reload instead of stacking duplicates. `set-hook -gu` correctly removes hooks.

### Command Chaining with Semicolons

Multiple commands can be chained with `;` on a single line, matching tmux behavior:

```tmux
bind-key M-s split-window -h \; select-pane -L
```

### Run Shell Output

`run-shell` now displays output in the status bar, matching tmux behavior. Background mode with `-b` runs fire and forget.

### Session Server Persistence

The psmux session server now survives SSH disconnects. On reconnect, sessions are intact and `psmux attach` reattaches normally.

### Bell and Alert Support

BEL characters (`\x07`) from programs are forwarded to your host terminal for audible beep. The `bell-action` option controls when bells are forwarded and when the status bar tab gets a bell flag.

### Pane Border Labels with Truncation

`pane-border-format` labels that exceed the pane width are now truncated with ellipsis instead of overflowing or clipping mid-character.

### Pane Title Management

`select-pane -T ""` correctly clears a pane title. The default pane title is the hostname, matching tmux convention. Programs can update the pane title via OSC 0/2 escape sequences (controlled by the `allow-set-title` option). See [pane-titles.md](pane-titles.md) for details on how this interacts with PowerShell and other shells.

### `pane_current_command` and Program Titles on Windows

On Linux, tmux reads the controlling terminal's foreground process group, so a program that sets its own process title (Node's `process.title`, for instance) shows that title in `#{pane_current_command}`. Windows has no equivalent. ConPTY has no `tcgetpgrp`, `Win32_Process.Name` reports the image name, and a console process has no main window title, so a program modified title is invisible to every process enumeration API. psmux therefore reports the **executable of the pane's immediate child**, which is stable and cheap but is not a service identity (#647).

The logical name is still reachable, through a different variable. A Windows program that names itself calls `SetConsoleTitleW`, which is what `process.title` does under the hood; ConPTY turns that into an OSC title on the pane's output stream, and psmux stores it as the pane title. Turn on `allow-set-title`, which is off by default:

```powershell
psmux set-option -g allow-set-title on
psmux list-panes -t gateway -F '#{pane_id}|#{pane_current_command}|#{pane_title}'
# %1|node|openclaw-gateway
```

That is the same string tmux would put in `pane_current_command` on Linux. It is valid only while the program that set it owns the console: an interactive shell rewrites the title on every prompt, so an idle PowerShell pane reports its working directory rather than any service name.

`#{pane_start_command}` is the third piece: it records the command psmux was asked to run, so nothing the program does to itself can change it. It is empty for a pane that got the default shell, including the first pane of a plain `new-session`, so a supervisor relying on it must create its pane with an explicit command.

To identify a service, combine a controller chosen window or pane name addressed by stable id, `#{pane_start_command}`, pane liveness (`#{pane_dead}` and `#{pane_pid}`), and a health check outside psmux such as a port probe. Treat `#{pane_title}` as a further signal once `allow-set-title` is on, and `#{pane_current_command}` as a coarse filter only. See [integration.md](integration.md#identifying-the-program-running-in-a-pane) for the full recipe.

### Multi-line Status Bar

`set -g status 2` enables a multi-line status bar with `status-format[0]` and `status-format[1]` fully rendering style directives like `#[fg=red]`, `#[align=left]`, and `#[fill=blue]`. Mouse clicks are hit tested on every status row, not only the first, and `#[range=window|N]` regions on any row switch to window index `N` (#593), so a window list placed on the second line is clickable.

### Status Bar Style Directives

The following inline style directives are now rendered correctly in status-format lines:

- `#[list]` for the window list region
- `#[fill=colour]` for background fill
- `#[align=left|centre|right]` for text alignment
- `#[range=...]` for click regions

### Format Variable Expansion in Bindings

The `-F` flag on `bind-key` now properly expands format variables, enabling plugins like smart-splits.nvim to query pane dimensions.

### Set Environment

`set-environment` and `show-environment` are fully functional. Environment variables set with `set-environment -g` are inherited by all new panes at the process level (no shell commands echoed). The `new-session -e VAR=val` flag also sets session environment correctly.

### Unbind All Keys

`unbind-key -a` correctly removes all key bindings across all key tables. You can also target specific tables: `unbind-key -a -T prefix`, `unbind-key -a -T root`, `unbind-key -a -T copy-mode`.

### Client Prefix Format Variable

The `#{client_prefix}` format variable is correctly set when the prefix key is pressed. This enables status bar indicators like:

```tmux
set -g status-right "#{?client_prefix,#[bg=red] PREFIX ,}"
```

### Window Zoomed Flag

The `#{window_zoomed_flag}` format variable is correctly maintained during zoom/unzoom operations.

### Capture Pane

`capture-pane -p` correctly outputs pane content to stdout, enabling scripts and integrations (including Claude Code agent team coordination) to read pane state.

### Split Window Percentage

`split-window -p <percent>` correctly creates splits at the specified percentage instead of defaulting to 50/50.

### Split Window Working Directory

`split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"` correctly resolves the format variable and opens the new pane in the current pane's working directory.

### End of Options and Dash-leading Values

`set-option` stops parsing flags at the option name, as tmux's getopt does, so a value that begins with a dash is stored rather than eaten: `set @k -u` writes the literal `-u` instead of silently deleting `@k` (#583). `send-keys` and `set-option` both honour `--` as an end of options marker (#562, #583), so `send-keys -l -- -rf` types `-rf`.

### Direct argv Execution after `--`

`new-window`, `split-window` and `new-session` treat a multi token command after `--` as an argv and execute it directly, exactly like tmux's `execvp` (#582). A single token stays a shell command string. Scripts that used `-- program arg arg` to bypass the shell on Linux now behave the same way on Windows, with no PowerShell profile in the path and `#{pane_current_command}` reporting the program.

### Window Target Resolver

`move-window` and `swap-window` honour `-s` and resolve `+N`, `-N`, `!`, `^`, `$`, `@id`, `{last}` style symbols, indexes and window names through a single tmux parity resolver (#602), and attached clients see the new window list immediately instead of a stale one (#601).

### Title-only `select-pane`

`select-pane -T` and `select-pane -P` set the pane title or style without moving the active window or pane, matching tmux (#592). Only a direction flag or `-l` changes focus.

### Bare Command Routing

A command with no `-t` reaches the session with the most recent activity, the same choice tmux's `cmd_find_best_session` makes, rather than whichever session was attached last according to a stale file (#603). A bare `attach` with nothing to attach to prints `no sessions` (#605).

### Singular Option Aliases

`show-option` and `show-window-option` are accepted alongside the plural forms (#586).

### Hexadecimal and Base64 Transport

`send-keys -H 68 69` writes single bytes to the pane, byte exact. `send-paste` takes a base64 payload at the CLI, so multi line text with quotes and semicolons is delivered as one bracketed paste and can never be misread as a second command.

### UTF-8 and CJK Support

Multi-byte UTF-8 characters (box-drawing, emoji, CJK text) render correctly in panes. Pasting CJK text no longer crashes the session. Japanese and Korean IME input is handled with minimal latency (the paste-detection heuristic was tuned to avoid misidentifying rapid IME bursts).

### Window-scoped Options

Every window carries its own option table, so a window-scoped write reaches one window and nothing else (#648, from the #647 WIN-01 report):

```text
psmux new-session -d -s s -n zero
psmux new-window  -d -t "s:" -n one
psmux set-option -w -t "s:zero" remain-on-exit on

psmux show-options -w -v -t "s:zero" remain-on-exit   # on
psmux show-options -w -v -t "s:one"  remain-on-exit   # off  (inherited)
psmux show-options -g -v remain-on-exit               # off  (untouched)
```

The chain is pane, then window, then global, the way tmux resolves an option. `-wg` writes the global window table, `-w -u` removes one window's entry so it inherits again, and `-p` still outranks `-w` on the pane that has it. `show-options -w -A` marks every inherited entry with tmux's `*`:

```text
psmux show-options -w -A -t "s:zero"   # remain-on-exit on
psmux show-options -w -A -t "s:one"    # remain-on-exit* off
```

Which store a write lands in follows the option NAME, as in tmux, so `setw status-left ...` still writes the session option. `@name` user options stay in the one session-wide map psmux reads them from everywhere, so set those with `-g` (or `-wg`).

Before #648 psmux kept a single ordinary option store and `-w` selected the same map as `-g`. The visible symptom was a reporting one (`zero=on one=on global=on`), but the pane reaper read that one flag for every window, so ordinary panes in an untargeted window stopped closing after `exit`. `-t` also dropped the window NAME and acted on the active window; it now resolves names, indices, `@id` and tmux's symbolic window spellings on the CLI, TCP, command-prompt and config-file routes alike.

Two window options keep a dedicated field alongside the table because other code reads them directly: `automatic-rename` still reports `off` for a window born with `-n NAME` (#266) and `window-size` still drives `resize-window`. Both stay in step with the table on a write and on a `-u`.

### Value-only `show-options -v`

`-v` prints the value and nothing else in every scope, so a script can compare stdout with `on` or `off` directly (#647):

```text
psmux set-option -p -t %0 remain-on-exit on
psmux show-options -p -v -t %0 remain-on-exit    # on
psmux show-options -pv  -t %0 remain-on-exit     # on
psmux show-options -p   -t %0 remain-on-exit     # remain-on-exit on
```

A named query answers for that one option only. As in tmux, an option that is not set in the queried scope's own store prints nothing and exits 0; add `-A` to fall back to the inherited value, which is then marked with `*` when the name is printed. A bare `show-options -p` still lists the whole pane store.

### Control Characters in Names and Messages

Window and session names are sanitized when they are set, the way tmux does it in `clean_name`, so a name can never carry a raw control byte and `#{window_name}` is always safe to drop into a tab separated or newline separated record (#647):

```text
psmux rename-window "w<TAB>x"   # stored and printed as w\tx
psmux rename-window "w<ESC>y"   # stored and printed as w\033y
```

`display-message -p` encodes its result the same way tmux does: `ESC` becomes `\033`, `CR` becomes `\r`, `BEL` becomes `\a`, any other control byte becomes a three digit octal escape, and valid UTF-8 passes through untouched. A tab and a newline are deliberately left alone, so a multi line `#{...}` result still prints as multiple lines.

Two things follow tmux by not changing. `list-panes`, `list-windows` and `list-sessions` hand back the `-F` string byte for byte, so a literal tab you put in your own format stays a tab (tmux stopped visually encoding command output in 3.6). `capture-pane`, `show-buffer`, `save-buffer` and control mode are never touched, because they carry pane bytes rather than metadata.

One deliberate deviation: a backslash is never doubled. tmux stores `C:\src` as `C:\\src`, which on Windows would corrupt every path shaped window name.

### Git Revision in `psmux -V`

`psmux -V` reports the commit the binary was built from. `git` is the preferred source, and when it is unavailable the build falls back, in order, to `.cargo_vcs_info.json` (present in every crates.io tarball), to the cargo git checkout directory name (`cargo install --git` checks a revision out into a directory named after its short hash), and finally to a `PSMUX_GIT_SHA` environment variable that release tooling can set (#647):

```text
psmux 3.3.8 (4d12898 2026-09-12)          # built in a git checkout
psmux 3.3.8 (4d12898 2026-09-12, dirty)   # built from a modified tree
psmux 3.3.8 (4d12898)                     # commit known, date not
psmux 3.3.8 (unknown commit)              # no revision recorded anywhere
```

`cargo install --git` uses libgit2 and never needs the `git` binary, so a machine without git on PATH used to install happily and then report `unknown commit`. The commit date is only ever available from git, so a fallback build prints the hash without a date.

### Per Pane Colour Palette (OSC 4 and OSC 104)

Each pane keeps its own 256 entry colour palette, exactly as tmux keeps one on every `window_pane` (#685). A pane child sets an entry with OSC 4 and clears it with OSC 104, and psmux substitutes the palette's RGB for an indexed colour at render time, which is where tmux does the same substitution in `tty_check_fg`, `tty_check_bg` and `tty_check_us`:

```text
ESC]4;4;rgb:00/00/80 ESC\      index 4 becomes #000080 in THIS pane
ESC]4;4;#000080 ESC\           the # form, also accepted
ESC]4;4;rgb:0000/0000/8080 ESC\   one to four hex digits per channel
ESC]4;4;rgb:00/00/80;6;rgb:00/80/80 ESC\   several pairs in one sequence
ESC]104;4 ESC\                 put index 4 back
ESC]104 ESC\                   put every index back
ESC]4;4;? ESC\                 answered from this pane's entry, then from the host terminal
```

This matters most for Windows console applications. A pane child on ConPTY announces its console colour table as OSC 4 and then paints with indexed SGR rather than true colour, so Far Manager's panels are `ESC[48;5;4m` against an OSC 4 that says index 4 is `#000080`. Before #685 psmux dropped the palette and re rendered the cell as a plain `ESC[44m`, which Windows Terminal painted with its own Campbell `#0037DA`. Far inside psmux now paints `#000080`, `#008080` and `#00FFFF` exactly as Far outside psmux does.

Three deliberate choices:

- **The palette is per pane and is never forwarded to the outer terminal.** Two panes with different palettes would fight over one terminal, which is precisely why tmux resolves it per pane instead.
- **A pane that never sets a palette is unchanged, byte for byte.** The substitution costs one null check per frame for such a pane, and nothing travels on the wire that did not travel before.
- **A respawn keeps the palette, RIS clears it.** tmux keeps the palette on the pane and clears it only on RIS (`ESC c`), `ESC]104` and `send-keys -R`, so a `respawn-pane` or `respawn-window` keeps it, along with the pane's history (#708). The respawn resets everything else the way tmux's `screen_reinit` does: the visible rows are cleared, the cursor goes home, the modes are reset and the alternate screen is left.

One platform limit, measured on Windows 11 build 26200: conhost swallows a **bare** `ESC]104 ESC\` on the ConPTY output path, so a pane child running under ConPTY cannot reach the clear-everything form. `ESC]104;4 ESC\` arrives normally.

## Behavioral Differences from tmux

A few commands intentionally behave differently from upstream tmux. These are deliberate choices, not bugs.

### `kill-server` with Multiple Sockets

In upstream tmux, each `-L <name>` socket is a fully separate server, and `kill-server` only ever affects the socket it was invoked on. psmux matches that: **a bare `kill-server` ends the default namespace and leaves every `-L` namespace running**, and `-L <name> kill-server` ends that one namespace only.

```text
psmux kill-server            # ends the DEFAULT namespace only; -L namespaces keep running
psmux -L work kill-server    # ends the "work" namespace only
psmux kill-server -a         # psmux extension: ends EVERY namespace in the data dir
```

`-a` (long form `--all`) is the psmux-only "stop everything" switch, for when you have lost track of background servers and want a clean slate. tmux has no equivalent, because on Unix each socket is a separate process tree you can see in `ps`.

Exit codes follow tmux: when there is nothing to kill in the scope, `kill-server` prints `no server running on <socket>` and exits 1, so `psmux kill-server || true` behaves the way scripts written against tmux expect. `-a` is a sweep rather than a request to one server, so it exits 0 even when it finds nothing.

**Changed after psmux 3.3.8 (#649).** Up to that release a bare `kill-server` tore down every socket at once, which meant one command in one shell could end somebody else's `-L` sessions in the same data dir. If you relied on that, use `kill-server -a`.

An attached client's `kill-server` (typed at the command prompt, or bound to a key) follows the same rule: it ends every server on the client's own socket, which is what tmux's single-process server does implicitly.

### Background Processes When a Pane Exits

On Unix, tmux leans on the kernel: closing a pane's terminal sends SIGHUP to its foreground process group, and anything deliberately detached (`nohup`, daemons, most GUI apps) survives. Windows has no SIGHUP and no pty process groups, so psmux walks the pane's process tree instead. By default, when a pane's shell exits on its own, psmux terminates the background children that shell left behind; without the sweep they leak invisibly along with a `conhost.exe` each, which in bulk can exhaust the desktop heap.

To get tmux-style survival for intentionally backgrounded processes, opt out with the `@kill-descendants` user option:

```tmux
set -g @kill-descendants off
```

Explicit `kill-pane`, `kill-window`, and `kill-session` always terminate the pane's full process tree regardless of this option. See the Dead Panes section in [configuration.md](configuration.md) for details.

## Format Variables

psmux supports 140+ format variables with full modifier support, including:

- Session/window/pane variables (`#S`, `#W`, `#P`, `#{pane_current_path}`, etc.)
- Style and color modifiers
- Conditional expressions (`#{?condition,true,false}`)
- Comparison operators (`#{==:a,b}`, `#{!=:a,b}`, `#{<:a,b}`)
- Logical operators (`#{||:a,b}`, `#{&&:a,b}`)
- Regex substitution (`#{s/pat/rep/:var}`)
- String operations: basename (`#{b:}`), dirname (`#{d:}`), lowercase (`#{l:}`), shell quote (`#{q:}`)
- Truncation and padding (`#{=N:var}`, `#{pN:var}`)
- Loop iteration over windows (`#{W:fmt}`), panes (`#{P:fmt}`), and sessions (`#{S:fmt}`)

## Named Paste Buffers

psmux supports named paste buffers, matching tmux behavior:

```powershell
# Set a named buffer
psmux set-buffer -b mybuf "hello world"

# Show a named buffer
psmux show-buffer -b mybuf

# Delete a named buffer
psmux delete-buffer -b mybuf

# Paste from a named buffer
psmux paste-buffer -b mybuf
```

Named buffers are separate from the default (anonymous) buffer stack. They persist for the lifetime of the session and can be used for inter-pane data exchange in scripts and automation workflows.

## Developer Integration: Using psmux as a tmux Drop-in on Windows

psmux implements the same CLI protocol as tmux. Any tool, library, or script that drives tmux via
subprocess commands will work on psmux with minimal or zero changes:

- The command syntax, flags, and output formats are the same, and psmux installs a `tmux.exe` alias
  so scripts that call `tmux` by name find it on the PATH without any code change.
- Stable IDs use the same scheme: `$N` for a session, `@N` for a window, `%N` for a pane. They are
  monotonically increasing and never reused during a server's lifetime.
- Control mode (`-C` / `-CC`) uses the same wire protocol, with `%begin`/`%end` framing and async
  notifications.
- libtmux works against psmux, with one Windows encoding caveat.

The one thing that is genuinely different on Windows is text encoding. psmux emits UTF-8, but the
default Windows console code page is often cp1252, so a Python caller that does not pass
`encoding="utf-8"` will garble non-ASCII output. Set `PYTHONUTF8=1` or pass the encoding explicitly.
This is what causes libtmux to return empty session lists on Windows.

The full developer guide lives in [integration.md](integration.md), which covers subprocess examples
in Python, PowerShell, Node.js, Go, and Rust, libtmux setup and its encoding fix, the cross-platform
project pattern, targeting syntax, psmux extension commands such as `dump-state`, environment
variable propagation, hooks, `wait-for` synchronization, and troubleshooting. Start there rather than
here for anything integration related.
